On further probing he came up with H/O having undergone surgery as a child for undescended testis. He was tall and lean (176cm tall) with not much of muscle mass. He was recently married. His sexual history was normal as he said. On generalised physical exam, no gynecomastia, but very scanty hair over his body. His hormonal profile showed normal FSH, LH, total testosterone but a low free testosterone. Transferrin saturation was normal. Prolactin was slightly elevated.What could be the diagnosis?? Could it be Klinefelter&#39;s syndrome, Semen analysis is pending, he had a single normal testis with other normal features except abscence of hair.</p>",
