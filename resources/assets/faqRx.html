        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


        <h3>How do I use WebMDRx to save on prescription drugs?</h3>
        <p>Saving money on your prescriptions with WebMDRx is as easy as showing your WebMDRx coupon at the pharmacy counter. You may print it out or display it on your phone.</p>

        <p>With WebMDRx, simply:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Search for your prescription and compare costs at pharmacies near you.
            </li>
            <li>
                Confirm the quantity, dosage, and form of your prescription.
            </li>
            <li>
                Print the coupon from the website, have it emailed to you, or have it sent to your smartphone.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How do I make sure my prescription dosage, quantity, or brand is properly selected?</h3>
        <p>
            When you enter your prescription, we will display the most commonly prescribed quantity, form, and dosage. WebMDRx will show you generic prescriptions over brand names, as they are often less costly. 
            If your doctor did not allow for generic substitution on your prescription, you may want to discuss that with your pharmacist.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you need to make changes to the pre-populated dosage, quantity, or brand, you can do so by selecting "Edit Preferences" on your prescriptions results page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Simply select the options that match your prescription, and the page will reload to show your savings that match your new prescription details.​
        </p>


        <h3>Why can’t I find my pharmacy?</h3>
        <p>
            Even if your pharmacy participates in the program, it may not always be listed in the search results. The search is designed to present the best options of lowest priced pharmacies near your selected location. 
            WebMDRx is accepted at over 35,000 pharmacies nationwide, 
            and we are working to add pharmacies all the time. To find out if your pharmacy accepts your WebMDRx coupons, you can call customer service at (844) 653-6491.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the customer service phone number?</h3>
        <p>
            Customer service can be reached toll-free by calling (844) 653-6491. It is available from 8 a.m. 
            to noon Eastern, Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern, Saturday and Sunday, for 365 days a year. 
            It can also be found on your WebMDRx coupon or on our website at <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the pharmacy will not accept my WebMDRx coupon?</h3>
        <p>
            If your coupon was not accepted for any reason, please immediately call customer service at (844) 653-6491. This number can also be found on your coupon.
        </p>

        <h3>How can WebMDRx help me save if my insurance covers prescriptions?</h3>
        <p>
            You can choose to use WebMDRx instead of your health insurance if WebMDRx prices are lower than your typical copay or if your health plan does not cover your prescription for any reason.
        </p>

        <p>
            There will be times when your prescription is either not covered by your insurance provider or the insurance copay is more expensive than what you would pay with WebMDRx. Also, if you have a high prescription deductible, 
            you may find that WebMDRx gives you more savings than the discounted rate you get through your insurance. In these cases, WebMDRx will save you more than if you were to use your insurance.
        </p>

        <p>
            WebMDRx cannot be used in combination with your insurance to lower your copay. If you choose to use WebMDRx, ask the pharmacist to run your prescription using your WebMDRx 
            coupon instead of your insurance card. Simple as that! You can ask to have one prescription run through WebMDRx and another through your insurance.
        </p>


        <h3>How much will WebMDRx cost me?</h3>
        <p>
            WebMDRx does not have subscription fees. There are no limitations to how often you use the program or the number of different pharmacies. 
            The WebMDRx coupon can be used by any of your family members and friends. The only costs to you are for your personal prescription medications purchased with WebMDRx that you pay at the pharmacy.
        </p>


        <h3>How much can I save with WebMDRx?</h3>
        <p>
            WebMDRx is designed to help you save as much as possible on your medications. Your savings will vary by medication and by pharmacy, 
            so be sure to check <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> before you visit the pharmacy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember to check your insurance coverage or see if any manufacturer’s coupons or rebates are available, because these might save you more than if you use WebMDRx.
        </p>

        <h3>Will any of my personal information be saved or shared?</h3>
        <p>
            No. WebMDRx does not require you to provide us with any personal information in order to take advantage of WebMDRx savings.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I lose my WebMDRx coupon/code? Can I get another coupon?</h3>
        <p>
            Of course. You can generate as many WebMDRx coupons as you like at any time, for any pharmacy and for multiple prescriptions. Simply have it sent to your phone or email, print it out, 
            download the app, or go to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a>. You can even visit <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> on your phone right at the pharmacy counter.
        </p>

        <h3>Who can benefit from WebMDRx?</h3>
        <p>
            Anyone who meets any of the following criteria can benefit from using WebMDRx:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you do not have insurance with prescription coverage</li>
            <li>If you have insurance and have limitations such as high deductibles, high copayments, or plan maximums (caps) on your benefits</li>
            <li>If your insurance does not cover the medications you need</li>
            <li>If you are in your waiting period for health care coverage</li>
            <li>If you have insurance and your generic copays are higher than the cost available with WebMDRx</li>
            <li>If you do not want to submit the medications under your current health insurance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Can I use WebMDRx if I have Medicare or Medicaid?</h3>
        <p>
            The WebMDRx coupon cannot be used in conjunction with Medicare or Medicaid or any other government program. You should compare the costs associated with both options before making a purchase.
        </p>

        <h3>Is WebMDRx health insurance?</h3>
        <p>
            WebMDRx is not health insurance. WebMDRx can only be used to save money on your prescriptions. Remember, if you do have health insurance or prescription coverage, you should always check your copay. You can choose to use WebMDRx instead of your health insurance when WebMDRx prices are lower than your copay or if your medication is not covered.
        </p>

        <h3>Can the members of my family also use my WebMDRx coupon?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. The WebMDRx coupon can be used by any of your family members, and you can even share it with your friends and neighbors. Prices can change, 
            so they should check <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> before going to the pharmacy. 
            They can also get their own free coupon at <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a>
        </p>

        <h3>What if I lose or misplace my WebMDRx savings coupon?</h3>
        <p>
            If you lose or misplace your coupon, simply visit <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> to generate a new one. All coupons are active immediately and ready for use.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need a WebMDRx coupon at the pharmacy to receive my savings?</h3>
        <p>
            No. You do not need to have your WebMDRx coupon with you when you fill your prescription at the pharmacy. If you have used your WebMDRx coupon at the same pharmacy location, your 
            WebMDRx information should be stored in the system. You can ask the pharmacist to look it up.
        </p>

        <p>
            If your information is not stored in the system, you need to provide the pharmacy with the BIN, PCN, Group, and Member ID numbers from your coupon. 
            As long as you have those four numbers with you, the pharmacist will be able to process your transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            We recommend that you always take your WebMDRx coupon with you to the pharmacy and present it with your prescription.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can generate a new coupon anytime you need by visiting <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a>.
        </p>


        <h3>Why is the price I paid at the pharmacy for my prescription using WebMDRx different than what I was quoted on the website?</h3>
        <p>
            When you search for the cost of a prescription, WebMDRx provides the most current pricing available at the time of that search. 
            If there is a difference in price, make sure that the type (generic vs. brand), quantity, dosage and form are all correct. Small differences, 
            like if a medication is extended or timed release, can make large price differences. WebMDRx does its best to show the expected price. However, pharmacies, like any other retailer, may change their prices. 
            Prices are subject to change and may vary based on available pharmacy inventory.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have searched again after checking that your search matches your prescription and the WebMDRx price at the pharmacy is not accurate, 
            please call customer service (844) 653-6491 to report the occurrence. 
            We will work to resolve the issue or help you understand why the price was different.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to print a new WebMDRx coupon every time I fill my prescription?</h3>
        <p>
            No. You can use the same WebMDRx coupon as many times as you want, at as many pharmacies as you want, and for all of your prescriptions or refills. 
            Be sure to check <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> to see the most up-to-date prices for each prescription.
        </p>

        <h3>Do WebMDRx coupons expire?</h3>
        <p>
            Your WebMDRx coupon will not expire.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most pharmacies will keep the WebMDRx information in their system attached to your customer profile so you can continue to save money without having to do anything! 
            We recommend that you always look up the latest prices on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> and take your WebMDRx coupon to the pharmacy. 
            You can generate a new coupon anytime you need by 
            visiting <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Does WebMDRx have prices for over-the-counter (OTC) medications?</h3>
        <p>
            WebMDRx provides savings for many prescribed OTCs. Simply search WebMDRx for your medication to see if it qualifies for savings. 
            WebMDRx only works with valid prescriptions for OTC medications. 
            Make sure you have a prescription. If you don't, ask your doctor to write one.
        </p>


        <h3>How does WebMDRx work?</h3>
        <p>When your WebMDRx information is entered into the pharmacy’s computer, the price of the prescription is calculated based on the pharmacy’s agreement with 
            WebMD’s pharmacy network management provider.</p>

        <p>
            If you already have insurance covering your prescription, you should ask your pharmacist if your insurance copay is lower than the WebMDRx price. 
            WebMDRx is ideal for prescriptions not covered by your insurance, or high-deductible prescription insurance plans.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the free WebMDRx coupon there are no deductibles, no subscription or enrollment fees, no paperwork or forms to complete, and everyone qualifies. 
            WebMD receives administrative fees from the pharmacy benefit administrator for offering this service. This program covers your entire family, 
            is pre-activated, and can be used immediately. You can share your coupon with anyone, including friends and neighbors. 
            You can also direct them to this website to print as many free coupons as they need.
        </p>


        <h3>Why does WebMDRx display generics over brand names?</h3>
        <p>
            WebMDRx’s goal is to save you as much as possible on your prescription medications. Generic medications are generally less expensive than branded medications, 
            which is why they are presented first in your results. If you want savings on a branded medication instead of the generic, 
            then simply select the brand name option on the Prescription Details page. In order to obtain the generic at the pharmacy, 
            you will need a valid prescription for the generic or your brand prescription must allow substitution. Ask your doctor to confirm if your prescription can 
            be used for the generic or to write you a prescription for the generic. 
            If you have a brand prescription that allows substitution, be sure to tell the pharmacy to fill the generic instead.
        </p>

        <h3>I want to reuse my WebMDRx coupon but my pharmacy or prescription has changed. Now what?</h3>
        <p>
            Not a problem. You can use your WebMDRx coupon for multiple prescriptions and across multiple pharmacies. 
            You should always check the current price of your prescription and pharmacy on WebMDRx.
        </p>

        <p>
            We recommend that you always take your WebMDRx coupon with you to the pharmacy and present it with your prescription. 
            You can generate a new coupon anytime by visiting <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a>.
        </p>


        <h3>How do I transfer a prescription?</h3>
        <p>
            Every pharmacy is different when it comes to transferring your prescriptions. Some let you complete the transfer online, 
            while others require you to call them. Either way, you will need to provide the new pharmacy with some basic information:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>The prescription information</li>
            <li>The name and phone number of your previous pharmacy</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The new pharmacy will then call your previous pharmacy and have your prescriptions transferred. While it varies from pharmacy to pharmacy, the transfer can take anywhere from a 
            few hours to a couple of days to complete. (You can provide your WebMDRx information over the phone or at the counter when you pick up your prescription.)
        </p>


        <h3>What if I change pharmacies?</h3>
        <p>
            No problem. Simply provide your new pharmacy with your WebMDRx coupon. You should always search WebMDRx so that you can compare the cost of your prescriptions at nearby pharmacies.
        </p>


        <h3>Does WebMDRx have prices for international pharmacies?</h3>
        <p>No. WebMDRx only displays prices and savings for pharmacies located in the United States and Puerto Rico.</p>

        <h3>Can manufacturer coupons be used with WebMDRx?</h3>
        <p>
            WebMDRx cannot be used in conjunction with manufacturer coupons. Manufacturer coupons, or copay cards, are savings offered by manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs. 
            Prescriptions purchased using a WebMDRx coupon may be less expensive than purchasing the same prescription with a manufacturer coupon. 
            You should compare the costs associated with both options before making a purchase.
        </p>


        <h3>If I am not a U.S. Citizen, can I use WebMDRx?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, anyone may use WebMDRx at pharmacies within the U.S. and Puerto Rico, regardless of whether or not they are a U.S. citizen.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there any age or enrollment restrictions?</h3>
        <p>
            As long as you are old enough to legally fill a prescription at the pharmacy, you are old enough to use WebMDRx. 
            These age requirements vary by state, so be sure to check with local regulations first before trying to fill your prescription at the pharmacy.
        </p>

        <h3>Does my doctor need to know about WebMDRx when writing my prescription?</h3>
        <p>
            No. You can generate your WebMDRx coupon before or after your doctor writes your prescription, and this will not affect your savings or the price of your prescription.
        </p>

        <h3>As an employer, how can my company and my employees benefit from WebMDRx?</h3>
        <p>
            If you have employees who are either not currently covered by the health plan you provide, are only partially covered, 
            have high-deductible plans, or are filling a medication with a higher copay or a medication not covered by their health insurance, 
            they may be able to take advantage of WebMDRx savings on their prescription drugs. 
            At no cost to you, your employees can use WebMDRx to find the lowest prices for their prescription drugs.
        </p>

        <h3>What medications can WebMDRx help with?*</h3>
        <p>
            All FDA-approved brand and generic prescription medications are eligible. You must have a valid prescription from a licensed doctor to use the program. 
            Search <a href="https://www.webmd.com/rx">WebMDRx.com</a> to find the best price.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Pharmacy Regular Price (Reg.)?</h3>
        <p>
            The regular price is an estimated amount that will be charged by the pharmacy to a person who does not have any prescription insurance or coupons, 
            commonly referred to as the cash price. The regular price is averaged using submitted data, including usual and customary price, 
            from recent transactions at the pharmacy or chain. The regular price is not guaranteed, is subject to change, 
            may vary at the time of purchase due to inventory availability and other factors, and may be inaccurate. 
            The regular price should only be used as a guideline to calculate possible savings with the program.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Walmart Generic Price?</h3>
        <p>
            The Walmart price is a calculated amount available through the Walmart Rx Program at Walmart and Neighborhood Market pharmacies in the United States, 
            except North Dakota, for certain generic drugs at commonly prescribed dosages. 
            The Walmart Rx Program prices are available at this 
            link: <a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-e286/k2-_85e442c0-01c0-40e8-ae97-06162066b801.v1.pdf">https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-e286/k2-_85e442c0-01c0-40e8-ae97-06162066b801.v1.pdf</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Walmart price should be verified by contacting the specific Walmart or Neighborhood Market pharmacy location where you intend to purchase your prescription as 
            the price may vary from state to state and from time to time, and not all formulations of a drug are covered. You may pay less or more than the Program price, 
            depending on the terms of your health plan/prescription insurance. The Walmart Prescription Program includes up to a 30-day supply for $4 and a 90-day supply for $10 
            of some covered generic drugs at commonly prescribed dosages; not all drugs covered by the $4 retail program are covered by the $10 retail program. 
            For supplies between 30 days and 90 days, the price will be prorated if the prescription is covered by both the $4 and $10 retail programs. Higher dosages cost more. 
            Prices for some drugs covered by the Walmart Prescription Program may be higher and may vary in some states. Prices may be higher in CA, HI, MN, MT, PA, TN, and WI. 
            Restrictions apply. Program pricing may be limited to select manufacturers of a covered drug and is available as long as supplies from such manufacturers are in stock 
            at the dispensing pharmacy. The Walmart Prescription Program Details are subject to change without advance notice.
