<p><strong>Reference</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<a name=q0 /><strong>What is included in the Reference?</strong></li>
<ul>
  <li>The Reference is comprised of a Drug Reference and a Clinical Reference.
    The Drug Reference includes detailed information on over 5,000 prescription drugs and brands, 
    over 900 over the counter (OTC) drugs and brands, and 100s of herbals and supplements.  
    The Clinical Reference includes over 4,000 detailed articles covering diseases, conditions, and medical procedures. 
    The Clinical Reference contains over 2,500 images and 150 videos.<br />
    <br />
    <a href="#top">[Return to top]</a><br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<li><a name=q1 /><strong>How do I search the Reference by keyword?</strong></li>
</ol>


<ol>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li>Tap the Search Reference field that appears at the top of your screen. </li>

<li>Start typing the name of any drug, OTC, herbal, or clinical reference topic. </li>
    
<li>Medscape search uses type-ahead which means the results are refined with each character you type. 
  The results that most closely match your search term will appear in the window below. </li>
    
<li>
  Note: when searching on clinical reference articles, only the subjects of articles are searched not the content in the article itself.  </li>
    <li>
    Hint: to hide the keyboard to see more results, select the Enter / Go button in the bottom right of the keyboard. To make the keyboard reappear, tap in the search field in the top.  </li>
    <li>
    Tap any result in the main window in order to view its detailed information.  </li>
    <li>Hint: below the search box you will see 4 ways to filter your search results: All, Drugs, Conditions, and Procedures. If you know that you are looking for a drug, for example, tap the Drugs button and only the matching drug results will be displayed.<br />
      <br />
    <a href="#top">[Return to top]</a></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ol start="3"><li><a name=q2></a><strong>How do I browse the Reference by drug class or topic?</strong></li> 
<ol start=1>

<li>To browse drugs, tap the 'Reference' link on the Home screen.
Next, tap the 'Drugs, OTCs, &amp; Herbals' link on the Reference screen. 
This will present a view of the Drug Reference organized by logical classes of drugs. 
For example, drugs for treating neurological conditions are found under the class Neurology under which 
you will find neurological drugs broken out further e.g. drugs that treat Alzheimer Disease. </li>

<li>Note: some drugs can be listed under more than one class. </li>

<li>Note: all herbal and supplements are located under the top-level class Herbs &amp; Supplements. </li>

<li>To browse Clinical Reference topics, select either Disease &amp; Conditions or Clinical 
Procedures from the Reference screen. You will find 2 - 3 levels of categories generally organized around body system, 
body part, and then disease and condition or procedure.<br />
<br />

</ol></ol>

<ol start="4">
<li><a name=q3></a><strong>How do I update my Reference to make sure that I have the latest drug and clinical information?</strong> </li>

<ol>
<li>Updates are generally released on a monthly basis. 
You will be notified of an update when you launch the application. 
The updates will includes changes and/or additions to the Drug Reference as well 
as articles in the Clinical Reference. Updates take 2 - 20 minutes depending on 
their size and your Internet connection (Wi-Fi is recommended for the fastest install time). 
To stay up to date, Medscape recommends that you install each monthly update. </li>

<li>If you skip the install at launch, you can manually check for updates at any time by tapping 
the More icon in the navigation bar at the bottom of your screen and then selecting Update Reference menu.</li> 
<li>
Tap the Get Updates button in the main window.</li>
<li>Follow the on-screen instructions in order to download and install the latest Reference updates. </li>
<li>Note: all users will always get the drug reference updates. However, in order to receive any new and updated 
clinical reference articles, you must first download the clinical reference for offline use. 
If you do not choose to download the clinical reference, your Medscape application will always fetch the 
latest clinical reference article from the Internet. The benefit is that your clinical reference will be 
up to date but the downside is that you may not have access to the Internet at all times.<br />
