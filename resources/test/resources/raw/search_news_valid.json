				"body": "(Reuters Health) - Providing parents with picture-based instructions - and with dosing tools that closely match the amount of medication needed - may help reduce cases of medication overdoses in children, researchers say. Poorly designed medication labels and dosing tools lead to dosing errors, especially when parents are given large cups for small doses, the study team writes in Pediatrics, June 27. “Parents frequently make errors in dosing medications for their children. We did this study because we wanted to find out how to redesign medication labels and dosing tools to help parents understand dosing instructions better,” lead author Dr. Shonna Yin told Reuters Health in an email. It is very easy to get confused when dosing liquid medications for a child, said Yin, a pediatrician at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. “To help make sure they give the right dose, parents should ask their doctor or pharmacist which dosing tool is best to use,” she said. The best tool depends on the amount of medication the parent needs to give the child, Yin said. “Using a tool that is too large or too small makes it more likely that a parent will make a mistake.” The researchers recruited 491 English- and Spanish-speaking parents of children age 8 years or younger, and randomly assigned them to one of four groups, each with a different combination of medication labels and dosing tools including assorted cups and syringes. Parents were given a medication label with instructions in text only, or both text and pictograms, plus dose measuring tools marked only in milliliters (mL) or in both mL and teaspoons. Participants were asked to demonstrate how they’d use the labels and to measure three different dosage amounts using three different tools. About 84 percent of parents made at least one error and almost 30 percent made at least one large error such as doubling the correct dose. There were fewer errors, however, when labels contained both text and pictograms and when dosing cups or syringes were close to and at least as large as the amount of medication needed. For a 2-mL dose, for example, the fewest errors were seen with the 5-mL syringe and for the 7.5-mL dose, the fewest errors were with the 10-mL syringe. In addition, parents were about 30 percent more likely to make mistakes when they used tools marked in mL and teaspoons compared to mL only. “It is important for parents to use a tool that has markings on it to help them measure out the right amount. This could be an oral syringe, a dropper, a dosing spoon, dosing cup, or even a measuring spoon that is usually used for cooking,” Yin said. When using any of these tools, parents should carefully check to see that the number and the units used on the tool match what they are trying to give, she added. “Mixing up milliliters and teaspoons can lead to a parent giving 5 times the dose. If there is no dosing tool at home that has markings on it, I would recommend going to the store to get one or trying to get one from the doctor or pharmacist,” Yin said. “The study makes it clear that it’s easy to make mistakes with liquid medicine and that using the right syringe can help and that instructions with pictures help as well,” said Dr. Kathleen Walsh, director of patient safety research at the James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio. “There are certain medicines that people tend to think of as safe but actually if you make a big dosing error can be very dangerous, for example, Tylenol or Benadryl are medicines you really want to be careful to give the right dose,” she said.

				"body": "(Reuters) - Johnson and Johnson has agreed to pay $33 million to resolve charges by most U.S. states that it misrepresented the manufacturing practices behind Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and other over-the-counter drugs that were eventually recalled. The settlement, announced by attorneys general for 42 states and the District of Columbia, resolves claims related to several products, including children's medicines, that were voluntarily recalled from 2009 to 2011. The list includes St. Joseph Aspirin, Sudafed, Pepcid, Mylanta, Rolaids, Zyrtec, and Zyrtec Eye Drops, the Illinois attorney general said in a news release. The company's Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc unit must also ensure that its marketing and promotional practices do not unlawfully promote over-the-counter drug products, the attorneys general said. The accord followed a string of recalls of millions of packages of drugs made by J and J's McNeil-PPC Inc unit, now part of Johnson and Johnson Consumer, over faulty manufacturing. According to the state attorneys general, McNeil put on the market batches of drugs that failed to comply with federal standards and were deemed adulterated as a matter of federal law. They claimed that McNeil misrepresented its compliance federal manufacturing rules and the quality of its over-the-counter drugs. \"Johnson and Johnson's disregard for proper manufacturing practices of children's medications was unacceptable,\" Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a statement. In a statement, J and J said that its \"recalls were precautionary and not undertaken on the basis of any health or safety risks to consumers, and we remain committed to providing consumers with safe and effective over-the-counter medicines.\" J and J's McNeil unit previously in 2015 pleaded guilty to selling liquid medicine contaminated with metal and agreed to pay $25 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation.

				"body": "Tired but Good Editor's Note: In part 1 of his account of his knee replacement surgery, knee replacement specialist Ira H. Kirschenbaum, MD, chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx, New York, described his experience as a patient up to and including his procedure. Here, in part 2, Dr Kirschenbaum discusses postoperative pain management, including the effectiveness of the multimodal pain management techniques his surgeon prescribed, his need for opioid medication; and the physical aspects of his recovery. Tired but Good August 25, 2016 This is postoperative day 3. This has been a good day so far. My pain ranges from a best of 1 to a worst of 3 out of 10 on a visual pain scale. I haven't taken anything but Tylenol® and Aleve® all day. I'm able to stand up pretty nicely for a patient who has had his left knee replaced. I'm a bit surprised, actually. I have always thought that my patients would have been in worse shape by this time in terms of pain, but we've been pretty aggressive with the multimodal pain medicines and ice. It's working. Last night was the last time I took any narcotics. I only took 10 mg of oxycodone at about 9 PM. I ended up waking up at 2:30 AM with a little bit of discomfort that was well controlled with two Tylenol. That's my pain story. 250 188 1 My knee function is quite good. I'm walking a bit better. I have a knee exercise that I'll be doing more of today. I do get tired a lot sooner than I would have expected. After walking around a lot this morning, I found myself very tired by 10:30 AM. I think a lot of my body energy is being directed toward my knee to heal it, so the rest of my body becomes correspondingly tired. I'm not getting dizzy or having any imbalance while walking, but I am aware that when I'm starting to get a little tired, I need to sit or lay down and rest. I took a nap this morning for about an hour and a half, something I don't usually do. The key is to be sensitized to my degree of tiredness, keep the fluids going, and keep the multimodal pain medications going. Other than that, it's been a good day. The Real World August 26, 2016 Woke up on this fourth day after surgery feeling remarkably well. Some generalized soreness, but I was able to move my knee to 103 degrees. How do I know? Measuring a joint is done with a goniometer. And yes, there is a smartphone app for that. Today I advanced to a cane. I had been using a walker. A cane felt more natural, and since I did some quadriceps exercises yesterday, my quadriceps strength is improving. As I was instructed in my physical therapy session before the operation, I gripped the cane in my right hand, the hand opposite my new knee, and carefully started walking. I was pumped. I managed to get my clothes on (regular clothes, by the way), climbed into a car (as a passenger), and went out into the real world. Getting into the car was not hard. I decided to sit in the back seat. I went over to my friend's business office and hung out for a couple of hours. Had lunch, worked on the computer, made some phone calls. As I mentioned yesterday, after major surgery, this kind of mental effort tires you out. My advice to patients is this: Whatever discomfort, pain, or fear you experience in the first few days, have faith that it will subside in a short while. Thinking About Pain August 27, 2016 It is now Saturday, the fifth day after my surgery. I am well past the time when most patients and surgeons conventionally feel that patients experience the most pain. I now have minor discomfort only. In my experience as a surgeon, total knee replacement is an operation in which we traditionally use quite a lot of opioids. Yet my opioid use has been minimal. A lot of it has to do with the adoption of modern multimodal pain techniques by my surgeon, which more and more surgeons are using. These techniques include intravenous acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) on a particular protocol; injections of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®) in the operating room mixed with standard bupivacaine; ice therapy; early mobilization; oral Tylenol around the clock; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both preop and immediately postop. I've been on this regimen since last Monday, when I had my procedure. Since then, I've taken oxycodone in 10-mg doses for a total of 30 mg over 4 days. I have taken no other opioids. Partly this is attributable to the success of the multimodal pain techniques. But I also attribute it to the expectations and trust I had that the pain would not be as great as what others who have had this surgery suggested it would be. My experience raises a number of questions. For example, when did I experience the most pain, how bad was it, and how did I manage it? I had the surgery on a Monday. I probably had the most pain from Tuesday afternoon to late Tuesday evening. This was a time when I think the standard bupivacaine was wearing off and the liposomal bupivacaine was kicking in—what is called a \"bridging\" time. The pain drifted to about 4 or 5 out of 10 on the pain scale—never more than that—and then by Wednesday morning the pain diminished to about a 3 as the liposomal bupivacaine started working at its full impact. So the pain was quite manageable using the multimodal techniques. At many hospitals, knee replacement patients receive two Percocets (two 10-mg tablets of acetaminophen/oxycodone) every 4-6 hours. Some hospitals give 30 mg of oxycodone twice a day in addition to that. My experience belies this approach. We have been stuck in a rut in the way we order opioids. In my case, I was able to use significantly lower amounts of pain medicine. I think the narcotics we give the patients to control pain need to be at a much lower dosage, and they need to be given over greater time periods. We also need to adopt a multilevel pain regimen that includes intravenous acetaminophen and liposomal bupivacaine, which reduce pain in the knee for 24-72 hours. I have used standard bupivacaine and, separately, standard bupivacaine with liposomal bupivacaine in my practice, and I have seen an absolute improvement in patients' pain on the second and third days from the use of liposomal bupivacaine. Whether this decreased the length of stay is hard to say, because we have a very short length of stay at my hospital (the average is around 2 days). I had my procedure as an outpatient, so length of stay was not my endpoint. Instead, my endpoints were patient satisfaction and patient satisfaction with pain relief, which was significantly better with the liposomal bupivacaine. I felt the bupivacaine wear off at about 11 PM on Monday, the day of my surgery. I had a short period of discomfort until the liposomal bupivacaine kicked in, which it definitely did, because I had significant pain relief most of Tuesday, when I did a fair amount of exercise. Tuesday night my knee was sore, but the liposomal bupivacaine, continued to work. On Wednesday I had pain of between 1 and 3 on the pain scale. That could only really be explained by the use of bupivacaine/liposomal bupivacaine, which allowed me to severely limit my use of opioids in the first couple of days. It also helped me prevent any dependency I might have developed, which might have caused me to reach for a pill for the pain. No Place Like Home No Place Like Home August 31, 2016 Today is Wednesday, a 9 days after my surgery. Two days ago, I traveled from Seattle, where the surgery was performed, back to New York, where I live. I chose to have my knee done, as an outpatient, by a close friend and colleague in Seattle. Aside from the inherent trust I had in my surgeon, I also am a firm believer in his enhanced recovery protocols. I use these protocols in my own practice. But no matter how modern these techniques are, total knee replacement is still a major operation. Regaining the ability to be safely mobile is a gradual process. I was still quite concerned about navigating through the airport, spending hours on a plane, and then getting back to my house. In joint replacement surgery, surgeons are concerned about the development of blood clots in the legs in the first few weeks postop. These clots can travel from the legs to a lung, causing serious health problems. Spending 5-6 hours in the air while possibly immobile needs to be mitigated. I had early mobility the first day after my surgery, sequential compression devices for over 12 hours a day on my legs, and chemical prophylaxis with warfarin (Coumadin®) for 3 days, followed by enoxaparin (Lovenox®) injections (self-injected) each day. These therapies were continued in flight. Enoxaparin aggressively thins the blood. Sitting in my seat on the plane, fully anticoagulated and with my leg pumps, and getting up every half-hour to stay mobile, gave me peace of mind. The Caregiver's Essential Role September 5, 2016 I don't believe that anyone can go through a knee replacement operation alone. You either need a mobile and dedicated caregiver 24 hours a day for a solid 2 weeks or you need to go to some type of rehab hospital. In recent years, there has been talk about joint replacement patients not needing to go to rehab facilities and instead recuperating at home. I suspect that this chatter has been perpetrated by government and insurance company administrators, and not by anyone who cares about the safety and satisfaction of patients, because patients who live alone or have limited caregivers at home cannot go home immediately after surgery. Here is a partial list of what a caregiver does: Makes sure that all of the prescriptions are available and within the patient's reach; Ensures that the patient has access to food; Helps position the patient on a chair or bed at times when the patient feels tired or dizzy; Observes the patient to ensure that he or she is walking safely; Helps the patient in the bathroom negotiate from the toilet to the shower; Helps the patient change ice packs; Fetches pain medications for the patient in the middle of the night as needed; Assists in transferring the patient from bed to chair to other rooms; and Helps in the communication with the patient's doctor in times of need. You need a person in the house full-time. A home health aide who is there for 4 hours a day, while helpful, is not enough. You need basic, nonmedical help around the clock. If you don't have that, then while you may not need to go to the most intense rehab facility in the world, you will require a 5- to 10-day stay at a basic skilled nursing facility that understands the joint replacement healing process. They will need to get you up and mobile 6-8 times a day; apply cooling therapy for your comfort, as needed; provide pain medications (if needed); and conduct formal physical therapy at least twice a day. A View Down the Line A View Down the Line September 22, 2016 I am now at 4 weeks post-surgery. The journey of healing is really amazing. It's not a linear experience. There are quite a few ups and downs; during the ups, everything feels great; during the downs, even I, as a surgeon, was getting worried. These vacillations primarily relate to function, motion, general vitality, and pain. Let me start with how I am at 4 weeks: I am walking well with no pain. I can walk up steps in a normal manner, barely needing to use the railing. Walking down steps is still difficult; I use the railing and place my hand on a wall on the other side for support. Sometimes I walk down with two feet on one step at a time. I can walk for about a quarter-mile around my neighborhood. I have not needed a cane since the end of week 1. My leg is fully straight and I can bend my knee to a 121-degree angle. I started driving this week without problems. I've been going to physical therapy three times a week for 90-minute sessions, which include moist heat, manual massage, quad sets (a number of different exercises), extension and flexion stretches, stationary bicycle, hamstring stretches, and a compressive cooling device. When I am home, I use my stationary bicycle and continue the exercises I learned in preop and postop physical therapy. I heat up my knee a couple of times a day and ice it down about three times a day. I start my day with 325 mg of aspirin, 660 mg of Aleve, and 650 mg of Tylenol. I take no more Tylenol or Aleve for the rest of the day. The aspirin is for anticoagulation, so I take another tablet at night. I have not felt the need for any further opioid medication. I think the keys to opioid reduction are: Preoperative patient education—really getting the patient to know what to expect regarding pain is critical. Preoperative caregiver education—almost as important as the first point. The use of multimodal pain techniques: IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®); injections during surgery that include liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®), which extend the pain relief for 2-3 days; NSAIDs (I used Aleve but some people use Celebrex®; it depends on what your stomach can tolerate); Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours; surgical techniques that protect from excess tissue damage; early activity, including range-of-motion exercises; and frequent ice packs/cooling of the knee. I will be returning to work the first week of October. Since I am the chairman of orthopedics at my hospital, my entire staff is going to be pleased, mainly because the ceaseless flow of emails I am sending them from home will stop—or at least abate. ",

				"body": "My Knee Is Now Your Knee Editor's Note: Ira H. Kirschenbaum, MD, chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx, New York, has performed over 3500 total knee replacements. When Dr Kirschenbaum needed a new knee himself, he kept a diary from a perspective he had taken for granted that he understood: that of his patients. Despite being an expert on the procedure he was about to undergo, much about the experience leading up to the surgery was unexpected, which Dr Kirschenbaum recorded in his diary. Part 1, presented here, offers his thoughts before and immediately after the procedure. Part 2, coming soon, includes his reflections on postoperative pain management. My Knee Is Now Your Knee August 17, 2016 I have always had a certain amount of knee pain, but at age 59, I am scheduled to have a left total knee replacement next Monday, 6 days from now. I am used to being the surgeon. This time I am someone else's patient. Since venturing from my fellowship in joint replacement surgery at the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia in 1991, I have performed over 3500 knee replacements without a sense that one day this might be my fate too. Performing a knee replacement is a surgical religious experience. It is thoughtful, elegant surgery coupled with a massively positive intervention in the quality of life of the patient. 250 188 1 In good hands, a knee replacement takes about 45 minutes to an hour to perform. The results are so good that when a less-than-optimal result happens, we surgeons experience a great sadness for our patients because we feel that we do the operation the same way each time—and, as such, we expect consistently good results. When the results are just not good, it's frustrating. Even if this only happens 3% of the time, all you have to do is crunch the numbers. If a surgeon does 200 knee replacements a year and 3% of patients are not happy with the result, that means that six people a year—a lot of people—are not pleased with the surgeon's attempt to make them feel better. This sometimes makes for a tough job. Now that I am about to be at the other end of the scalpel, I have two fears. The smaller one is the pain after surgery. That will be temporary. Considering that my surgeon uses a multimodal approach to pain—with many medications and modalities, as well as the use of a long-acting local anesthetic—I think the pain will be manageable enough. We shall see. The bigger concern is whether, despite the skill of my surgeon, I will be in that 3% of patients who have a less-than-optimal result. This is the group in which everything went well in the operating room, the x-rays looked great, and by all accounts their results should have been home runs, and yet they weren't. In my past 25 years in surgical practice, I have seen too many patients who were in that 3% to know that it is impossible to predict whether I will be one of them. This Is Not Happening to Me! This Is Not Happening to Me! August 17, 2016 It is really a strange moment of disbelief—that you will lose a part of your body. When this moment happens, you try to look back to see when it all started. Everyone can go really far back—to Pop Warner football or to a host of other relatively uneventful but memorable knee injuries. Unless you had a major trauma to your knee (which I never did), most knee arthritis—the most common disease that leads to knee replacement—is not easily explained, other than that somehow it was in your body's master plan for you. Whether this was somehow inherited in your family's genes or is unique just to you, we really don't know. The best you can say is that it is fairly common; over 1 million people each year need joint replacements in the United States alone. It is really a strange moment of disbelief—that you will lose a part of your body. I remember the last time I ran, though. It was in the fall of 2012. I thought about that time when it became clear that I was going for a knee replacement. My youngest son and I were coming home from a New York Knicks basketball game and had the chance to take the 10:36 PM train out of Grand Central Station if we moved fast enough. The consequence of missing the train was having to take the 11:05, and considering that the food court in Grand Central was closed by then, there was no intelligent reason to be waiting around. We had to start running. Having run track in junior high school and played football in high school, running was simply running. No biggie. Bolting to the S train, the shuttle to Grand Central, I heard a pop in my knee, and it buckled with the simple clarity of PAIN! For the rest of the successful journey to catch the 10:36, I walked fast. No self-respecting New Yorker misses a train, even if it means hopping on one leg. I never ran again after that day. Fast forward to September 2015. I was increasing my exercise regimen—nothing crazy, mind you: about a half hour of weights and the same amount of time doing cardio. I did a particularly vigorous quads set on a machine, and the next morning the pain in both knees was incredible. I fully expected that with a little rest, ice, Aleve® (naproxen), and time, I would be back to baseline. The right knee rapidly improved. The pain never stopped in the left knee, however, and a cascade of events had begun that caused the further demise of that joint. When I eventually got an x-ray and saw bone on bone, I have to admit that I sensed the left was doomed. I was not going to let this happen—a knee surgeon needing a knee replacement so young—so I embarked on an aggressive but conservative treatment journey. Anything But Surgery! August 17, 2016 Once you truly need a knee replacement, there really isn't a lot you can do to avoid it. The only people, in my experience, who can avoid a knee replacement by trying a particular exercise regimen or injection product don't really need a knee replacement in the first place. Once the bone on one side of the joint touches the bone on the other side and you begin that terrible painful slide down into arthritis pain, it is unlikely that you can avoid surgery. You can definitely do some maneuvers to temporarily relieve the pain, and as long as you continue to do these things, you can postpone the inevitable for a few months or maybe a year. As in any situation, there are some exceptions, and everyone has a unique story. Some people say that they derive pain relief from Synvisc-One® (hylan-G-F 20) or glucosamine, even though such results are not based on hard science, but these products do nothing to lubricate the joint or build cartilage. Nevertheless, I tried them. I did physical therapy focused on strengthening my knees. I took glucosamine. I did Synvisc-One injections. I did cortisone injections and took 600-1200 mg of Aleve liquid gels daily. The Aleve worked in bringing the pain down from a high of 8 to a low of 5 on the visual analog scale. Everything else was no-go. I still intend to recommend to my patients all of the modalities that failed for me. Even if a small percentage of patients do well, these modalities are so minimally invasive that there is no harm in trying. So go for it. But if your x-rays show that your knees are done, then they are probably done. Denial works, though. \"Who needs to run or even walk quickly anymore?\" I thought. \"There are more than enough Netflix and Amazon TV series to avoid ever needing to leave the couch.\" So what if it takes me 15 minutes to walk across the street. This line of thinking begins to run thin. Life is motion, and motion is life. But being in denial helped me hold out for 4-6 months, until nearly everyone I knew was saying, \"When are you finally going to do something about that knee?\" \"All right, already,\" I replied. \"I'll go get major surgery so you don't have to feel so much pain when you watch me walk!\" Preoperative Preparation Preoperative Preparation August 17, 2016 No matter how many patients I prepared for surgery as a surgeon, from a patient's perspective, I see how complex it is. There are so many pieces to the puzzle. The major issue: Everyone who has to prepare for surgery had a life before having to prepare for surgery. Now you need to take time out for the preparation. No matter how many patients I prepared for surgery as a surgeon, from a patient's perspective, I see how complex it is. There are so many pieces to the puzzle. There are quite a few categories of preparation: your mindset, your professional life, your medical life, your health and personal finances, your personal life, and your surgery education. It's not as easy as it looks. A whole bunch of people have to do a whole bunch of things separately and distinctly from each other to make everything come together on a particular day so that afterward the patient can feel a whole bunch better. It starts with preparing your mindset. I needed to wrap my brain around the enormity of the concept of having surgery—the pain, the time off from work, and the change in my daily lifestyle, just to mention a few things. Early on, this knee surgery needed to be placed high on my priority list. Organizing my professional life was no small feat. Patients who have surgery when they are younger are typically working, and I was no different. When you are going to be out of work for 6-12 weeks, figuring out how to turn work down is a challenge. I decided it would take 3 months to get things in order, so I scheduled my surgery appropriately. Truth be told, a week before my surgery, I was still scrambling around. So much for a plan. I was glad that I told a lot of people at the hospital that I was having surgery so that my preparations were not seen as being out of context. I needed a plan for leaving and a plan for returning. I planned to recuperate for all of September, have office hours only in October, return to 50%-75% of my normal surgery schedule in November, and then return to work full time in December. I was curious to see if I could stay on course. You never really know how sick you are until your primary care doctor prepares you for surgery. As a surgeon, I always thought that I saved people's lives just by sending them to a primary care doctor for preoperative preparation. At that meeting, the primary care doctor would often find a host of illnesses unrelated to their surgeries and put the patients on a treatment plan. Fortunately, in my surgical pre-op visit, there were no surprises. My internist recommended some cardiac testing, and the chairman of medicine at my hospital reviewed my excruciatingly normal tests. My medical life was in order. Health finances are harder to understand than an algebra question. There are a million deductibles and fine-print rules; none are really advantageous to patients. For me, there was an interesting twist: Financially, my surgery was being performed under one of the first commercial bundled (ie, a global flat fee) payment programs for outpatient joint replacement. By having the surgery done as a bundle, there are no billing surprises. I had more than enough sick leave, short-term disability, and a plan to return to work within a reasonable time, so personal finances would not be a problem. Still, this was something I needed to calculate. My personal life, however—from my mobility to how I would spend my time—would be upended by the surgery. At this point, I am not even close to anticipating how much time I will need to devote to healing. This is likely to be a challenge. I have an advantage over most patients when it comes to surgery education. But even for an orthopedic surgeon, there is a lot to learn. My operation is taking place in an unfamiliar hospital, and the protocols to be used are also a bit unfamiliar. I want to try my best to be a good patient through the process. Pre-op Physical Therapy Pre-op Physical Therapy August 18, 2016 I finished my preoperative physical therapy this morning. For many years, I ordered pre-op PT for my patients but was never really sure of its value. Now I am sure. It's really great. It lowers the fear of what to expect. In a controlled setting, my therapists reviewed all of the exercises in my regimen before I experienced postoperative pain. They were caring and comprehensive. It's amazing how every little thing—from which foot to put first to how to position your leg—has a science behind it. I really valued this appointment. We discussed exercises, equipment, and modalities to decrease the pain. Pre-op PT: Don't go into the OR without it! The Pain Epiphany August 19, 2016 I woke up this morning with a remarkable amount of pain in my knee. This should be no surprise. In 3 days, I am getting my left knee joint surgically replaced because of the pain. As I limped across the room, I realized that this is how I had woken up for many days over the past few months, and in a strange way, I had gotten used to this pain as part of my life. I did fewer errands, walked up and down the stairs at home fewer times, and avoided doing many things that I used to do. So it hit me that, very soon, I would be saying goodbye to this pain. I almost didn't remember what it was like to be unrestricted in my activity, and it is amazing how insidious pain is as it creeps into your daily routine and attaches like bamboo roots to your brain. Fortunately for me, daily Aleve was all I really needed to take the edge off the pain, but I know that other people need stronger medications. I am sure that their dependence on these medications happened slowly over time and that not all of these people had a surgical solution to their problem. While I am not looking forward to the pain after the surgery, I am looking forward to no more pain after I heal. The Countdown August 20, 2016 Two days before surgery, I just want the surgery to be done. From the surgeon's point of view, the day before surgery is just a regular day. I would have planned all of the operations I had scheduled a week before so that all I had to do was show up. As the patient, it is a different story. I am going through a checklist that my surgeon gave me. There seems to be way more stuff to do as a patient than I thought there was. After doing over 3500 knee replacements, I guess that reviewing the list with patients is second nature, but when you're actually the patient, there is a lot to remember: Prescriptions: pain medications, blood thinner, nausea meds; Antibacterial shower gel; Walker, cane, elevation pillow, raised toilet seat, shower seat; Foot pumps; Ice packs, and Incentive spirometer. I am picking up my wife from the airport today. I can't even imagine the stress my surgery is putting on her. The caregiver shares in the pain and the process. Fortunately, this is time-limited until I get better. I just got a text reminder to fill out my preoperative patient-reported outcomes scores. These forms let my surgeon know how I am doing throughout the process. They also allow for comparison with other patients. I am managing a flurry of well-wishers on Facebook, LinkedIn, and email and expect to get really busy today waiting for the surgery. There's not much else to do. Surgery Day Surgery Day August 22, 2016 I got to the surgery center at about 6 AM. Everyone there knew the entire protocol, knew what to do, and knew what I needed to do. It is not that I am surprised, but I am pleased it happened that way. After an interview with the intake nurse and then the anesthesiologist, the circulating nurse walked me to the operating room. The surgery ended at 9:30 AM. I am recuperating at the home of my surgeon, a personal friend. I was in his house before noon. It is now 5 PM. I have no pain. I received a long-acting local anesthetic during the procedure. It's still working. But I know I have a long road ahead of me. The pain would eventually arrive, and I needed to be ahead of it. I started taking two regular-strength Tylenol® (acetaminophen; 650 mg) every 4 hours while I was awake and two Aleve twice a day. I had some heavier meds in tow just in case. I also needed to be very compliant with my anticoagulation plan. I had started taking Coumadin® (warfarin) 5 mg the previous night and had just taken my second dose. After the third dose, I would be switching to Lovenox® (enoxaparin) for 10 days and then to aspirin for 6 weeks. I also had my portable sequential compression device (SCD) pumps to prevent deep vein thrombosis. The Second Day After Surgery August 24, 2016 There is a lot of talk about patient satisfaction in healthcare. I think that we need to do more than talk about it. We need to do something about it. It starts with what patients want. I am fortunate that my surgeon is a huge patient advocate. It is the second day after surgery. I am laying down now with my knee elevated, with pain a 1 out of 10. I am a satisfied patient. Multimodal pain-relieving strategies are important. For my surgeon, this means preoperatively starting with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs—in my case, Aleve), intravenous Tylenol, injections in the knee that include plain bupivacaine (lasts 12 hours), liposomal bupivacaine (lasts 24-72 hours), and tranexamic acid (for bleeding control). The total cost of these injections, which now leave me with minimal pain on the second day after surgery, is approximately $350. That's it! Now that's a value to get patient satisfaction. Recently I heard of a hospital that is removing the intravenous Tylenol and the liposomal bupivacaine because it cost them too much, and they did not achieve improved length of stay. I have seen this operation from both sides now, and of the things that make patients satisfied, pain control takes precedence. For a $20,000 operation, a hospital or surgeon unwilling to spend $350 of that on pain control just does not care about patient satisfaction. In the first 2 days after the surgery, I exercised quite a bit and was very sore at night. I had more soreness than I wanted, so I took Tylenol 650 mg and oxycodone 10 mg twice on the second night. That's all the opioids I took in 48 hours. When I woke up the next morning, I went back to Tylenol and Aleve. Because of my pre-op physical therapy session, I am on target with the prescribed exercises, using a walker for getting around. I am also using my incentive spirometer to inflate my lungs to prevent pneumonia. In part 2 of this diary, I'll report on my postoperative pain management. ",

As a result, many older adults turn to over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids, that is, products with diphenhydramine or doxylamine. However, these products are indicated only for occasional difficulty with sleep, not for chronic use; and their safety and efficacy has not been well established in general and in older adults specifically. To engage national stakeholders in a discussion of OTC sleep aids in older adults, the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) convened a multidisciplinary workgroup. The Workgroup examined differences between younger and older adults in sleep health and use of OTC sleep aids using data from the National Health and Wellness Survey; assessed the pharmacologic properties and medication effects of OTC sleep aids; and worked with stakeholders to promote strategies for safe and effective use. Older adults are more likely to take diphenhydramine or doxylamine products 15 or more days in a month, an indicator of inappropriate use. The Workgroup recommends research to investigate the ways older people use OTC sleep aids. The goal should be reduction in inappropriate use and associated risks, such as daytime sedation, compromised cognitive function, and falls. In addition, the Workgroup recommends a greater role for community pharmacists in counseling older adults on appropriate use of OTC sleep aids. Introduction Getting a good night's sleep can be challenging for older adults with chronic medical conditions or pain, which often interfere with sleep. As a result, many older adults and their caregivers turn to over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids to promote sleep. However, these products are indicated only for occasional difficulty with sleep, not for chronic use; and their safety and efficacy has not been well established in general and in older adults specifically. In older adults, currently available OTC sleep aids may result in daytime sedation, compromised cognitive function, and falls and car crashes. They may also increase the risk of anticholinergic-related adverse events, such as blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, and increased intraocular pressure. To engage national stakeholders in a discussion of safe and effective use of OTC sleep aids in older adults, the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) convened a multidisciplinary workgroup and organized a series of national summits. The first summit took place in October 2013. It brought together experts from a number of fields to review data on sleep health and use of OTC sleep aids among older adults. The group recommended several policy initiatives to support sleep health in older adults and a multipronged effort to improve sleep health modeled on other successful public health campaigns. A follow-up national summit, convened by GSA in June 2014, opened the discussion to include stakeholders from a variety of professions involved in sleep health and aging, including psychologists, sleep medicine physicians, pharmacists, injury researchers, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory staff. Results from the OTC Sleep Aids Workgroup have appeared in a number of GSA publications: Sleep Health and the Appropriate Use of OTC Sleep Aids in Older Adults (GSA, 2013), Sleep Health and the Appropriate Use of OTC Sleep Aids in Older Adults: Update (GSA, 2014), and Spotlight on OTC Sleep Aids and Sleep Health in Older Adults (2013) in the What's Hot series. GSA also sponsored two webinars to disseminate Workgroup efforts. In this Forum contribution, we build on these efforts to examine the challenges posed by OTC sleep aid use among older adults. We focus on three key issues: (a) What is different about sleep disturbance and OTC sleep aid use among older and younger adults? (b) What is different about the activity of OTC sleep aids in older and younger adults? And (c) given such differences, what kinds of education or policy changes would increase safe and effective use of OTC sleep aids among older adults? Sleep Disturbance Among Older Adults Sleep Disturbance Among Older Adults While sleep is a biological imperative, the optimal amount of sleep varies by age group (ranging from over 15hr/day for infants to about 7–8 in old age). Even within age groups, there is variability in need for sleep. Overall, Americans get less sleep than they need. Data from polls conducted by the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) show that Americans sleep an average of 6hr and 31min each night, about an hour less than the mean of 7hr and 13min they admit they need to function at their best (National Sleep Foundation, 2013). NSF has recently published recommendations for the appropriate amount of sleep time at different ages (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has also developed recommendations, which are still under discussion. Sleep may be disturbed for a variety of reasons, including extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors include a decrease in periodic environmental stimuli (e.g., exposure to sunlight), inactivity, and ambient factors such as excessive noise and light during the sleep period, as well as self-imposed sleep restriction. In hospital and institutional settings, nursing care activities throughout the night can disrupt sleep. Intrinsic factors include medical conditions and associated symptoms, such as pain, as well as medications used to manage these conditions. Other intrinsic factors include alterations in the internal circadian clock and increases in the prevalence of primary sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, various parasomnias, and sleep-disordered breathing/sleep apnea. Insomnia should be distinguished from sleep disturbance. \"Insomnia\" is a disorder defined by (a) having difficulty sleeping (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or not feeling rested after sleeping), (b) which occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep, (c) which is associated with daytime impairment or distress, and (d) which occurs at least three times per week for at least 1 month (Roth, 2007). DSM-V further distinguishes between \"chronic insomnia\" for this level of sleep problems lasting 3 months or longer and \"short-term insomnia\" of less than 3 months. \"Sleep disturbance,\" by contrast, is difficulty sleeping one to two nights in a week over 2 weeks and is not specific. It can be the result of an acute event (such as injury or jet lag) or a symptom of other sleep disorders. OTC sleep aids are indicated for sleep disturbance (\"occasional sleeplessness\"), not insomnia. A major challenge in investigating sleep health and OTC sleep aids is confusion between insomnia and sleep disturbance. Unfortunately, surveys of sleep health do not typically distinguish between the two. Population-based estimates of the prevalence of \"sleep disturbance\" in the United States by age and gender are available in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) sleep module. Sleep disturbance in the BRFSS is elicited by asking, \"Over the last 2 weeks, how many days have you had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep or sleeping too much?\" Dichotomizing results to identify respondents reporting a complaint &lt;6 or ≥6 days in a 2-week period reveals an overall decline in acute sleep disturbance at older ages (Grandner et al., 2012). For example, among women aged 18–64, 20%–25% met the criterion for sleep disturbance. At ages 65 or older, the proportion drops below 20% and is lowest among women aged 80+, with only 17.7% reporting sleep disturbance. A smaller proportion of men report sleep disturbance at every age, and by age 80+ only 15.4% report sleep disturbance. Independent correlates of sleep disturbance identified in the BRFSS include nonwhite race/ethnicity, poorer self-rated health, and depressed mood. Note that this measure does not distinguish insomnia from sleep disturbance. The 2-week window of the question makes it difficult to distinguish the two, each of which may have different correlates. Separating sleep disturbance and insomnia may give a different picture of the age-related prevalence of sleep problems. The BRFSS finding of declining sleep disturbance with greater age should be interpreted with a number of caveats. First, the nature and chronicity of sleep disturbance may vary with age. One study found older adults more likely to report early morning awakenings and daytime sleepiness than younger adults (Soldatos, Allaert, Ohta, &amp; Dikeos, 2005). Second, reports of less sleep disturbance in old age stand in contrast to declines in many objective sleep parameters, such as total sleep time and slow-wave sleep, as indicated by polysomnography (Ohayon, Carskadon, Guilleminault, &amp; Vitiello, 2004). Thus, response bias may be at work, with older adults using different standards for adequate sleep than younger adults. They may have an expectancy of age-related declines in sleep quality and hence may be less likely to report sleep problems. Third, older adults face fewer of the life stressors that affect sleep, such as childbearing and work, are more likely to be retired, and are less likely to use technologies associated with interruption of sleep, such as electronics in the bedroom. Societal and cohort factors may thus play a role, along with socioeconomic status (Patel, Grandner, Xie, Branas, &amp; Gooneratne, 2010). Finally, the BRFSS relies on telephone interviews of people residing in the community and thus necessarily excludes older people in poorest health, who are less likely to participate in surveys and more likely to reside in skilled care facilities. Research with older people suggests that older adults without medical or psychiatric problems are less likely to exhibit sleep problems and that sleep disturbance is not a normal part of aging (Vitiello, Moe, &amp; Prinz, 2002). Healthy older adults experience much less sleep disturbance than those with multimorbidity (Ohayon et al., 2004). In general, the more chronic medical conditions and the greater their severity, the worse people sleep (Zee &amp; Turek, 2006). Diseases associated with poor sleep include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, mood disorders, cognitive decline, pain conditions, and neurologic disorders (McCurry, Logsdon, Teri, &amp; Vitiello, 2007). Recent research also suggests a bidirectional relationship between sleep loss and certain conditions, such as dementia, pain conditions, and depression. For example, sleep loss increases amyloid-β in the brain and its accumulation has been associated with Alzheimer's disease. With increasing amyloid-β, we see increased wakefulness and altered sleep patterns (Ju, Lucey, &amp; Holtzman, 2014). In older adults, the effects of poor sleep extend over many domains. Documented impacts of poor sleep in older adults include difficulty sustaining attention, slowed response time, and impairments in memory and concentration (Cricco, Simonsick, &amp; Foley, 2001); decreased ability to accomplish daily tasks (Ancoli-Israel &amp; Cooke, 2005); increased risk of falls (Stone et al., 2008), inability to enjoy social relationships; increased incidence of pain and reduced quality of life (Léger, Scheuermaier, Philip, Paillard, &amp; Guilleminault, 2001); risk of traffic accidents (American Automobile Association, 2014), increased consumption of health care resources (Hajak et al., 2011); and shorter survival (Dew et al., 2003). Despite this pervasive impact of sleep on health and well-being, sleep difficulties in older adults are under-recognized in medical practice and therefore undertreated. One survey found that adults who reported insomnia were unlikely to discuss it with their health care provider (Ancoli-Israel &amp; Roth, 1999). Only 5% of respondents said that insomnia was a primary reason for visiting a health care provider, and 26% said it was a secondary reason. Fully 69% of respondents never discussed their sleep disturbances with a health care provider. These data point to the need for health care providers to be more proactive about gathering information about their patients' sleep health and efforts at treatment, including, when appropriate, use of OTC sleep aids. OTC Sleep Aids and Strategies for Addressing Sleep Disturbance OTC Sleep Aids and Strategies for Addressing Sleep Disturbance Available OTC sleep aids all include diphenhydramine or doxylamine, \"first-generation antihistamines\" approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alone or in combination with other products, such as OTC analgesics. Diphenhydramine is found in the majority of products under a variety of brand names, including Nytol, Sominex, Tylenol PM, Excedrin PM, Advil PM, Unisom SleepGels, and ZzzQuil . Doxylamine is found in Unisom SleepTabs, Equaline Sleep Aid, and Good Sense Sleep Aid . Other products, such as Benadryl and a variety of pain relief-sleep combinations also contain diphenhydramine. Although the agents are indicated only for treatment of occasional sleeplessness, several lines of evidence assessed by the Workgroup suggest that a subset of older adults may use them chronically to treat insomnia or as part of routine self-care. Beyond FDA-approved therapies, several dietary supplements, including valerian, tryptophan, and melatonin, are used as sleep aids. In general, evidence to support their use is lacking and questions remain about their safety, especially when used chronically (Ramakrishnan &amp; Scheid, 2007). Unlike OTC and prescription products, dietary supplements receive virtually no scrutiny from the FDA. Other common strategies to address sleep disturbance include alcohol use, a behavior that unfortunately disrupts sleep and interacts with sleep-promoting agents. Up to 28% of patients report using alcohol to promote sleep (Johnson, Roehrs, Roth, &amp; Breslau, 1998). Although alcohol may reduce sleep-onset latency, it is not recommended as a sleep aid because alcohol fragments sleep in the second part of the night and can increase daytime sleepiness and promote future sleep disturbances. Evidence suggests that nonpharmacological treatments for chronic insomnia, such as cognitive behavioral therapies, relaxation techniques, or exercise, are effective in older adults. However, more research is needed on the efficacy of nonpharmacologic treatments for occasional sleep disturbance, as opposed to chronic insomnia, to determine if these approaches are also effective in older and younger adults with acute sleep disturbances. Use of OTC Sleep Aids by Older Adults Use of OTC Sleep Aids by Older Adults Few data are available on use of OTC sleep aids. One study suggests that 10% of adults aged 18–45 years use OTC sleep aids. The majority (70%) of these individuals used the products for less than 1 week at a time, and the overwhelming majority (84%) used the products less than a total of 30 times in a year. However, 9% of individuals used the products for 4 weeks or more, and 3% had used them 180 times or more in the past year (Johnson et al., 1998). To examine differences between younger and older adults in sleep health and use of OTC sleep aids, the workgroup analyzed cross-sectional data from the National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS), an Internet-based, Institutional Review Board-approved health survey of adults aged 18 years and older. A total of 75,000 adults participated in the 2013 wave of the survey, which is weighted to reflect the total U.S. adult population aged 18+ of 223.8 million (Kantar Health, 2013, 2014). The NHWS Internet panel recruits participants through opt-in e-mails, co-registration with other panels, e-newsletters, and online banner placements. Panel members are limited in the number of annual surveys they complete and receive points that can be exchanged for prizes. Invitations to participate in the NHWS use random stratified sampling to ensure that NHWS participants are representative of the adult population in the United States. The NHWS has been used in a number of studies assessing health behavior (DiBonaventura, Wintfeld, Huang, &amp; Goren, 2014; Goren, Annunziata, Schnoll, &amp; Suaya, 2014). Participants in the NHWS reported their experience regarding sleep, including \"symptoms of sleeplessness,\" and whether they experience or have been diagnosed with \"insomnia\" or \"sleep difficulties.\" The survey also asked participants whether they had primary sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, various parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing/sleep apnea, and/or various circadian rhythm disorders. People reporting such primary sleep disorders were excluded from these analyses. Results from the NHWS for the U.S. adult population aged 18+ are shown in Figure 1. Approximately 49% of the participants in the NHWS reported that they experienced at least some symptoms of sleeplessness in the past 12 months. An additional 2% of the surveyed population did not report regularly experiencing these symptoms but did report experiencing insomnia/sleep difficulties. Extrapolating to the population aged 18+, 115 million individuals in the United States experience symptoms of sleeplessness each year, and an additional 3.8 million report insomnia/sleep difficulties. To establish the prevalence of sleeplessness with functional consequences, Figure 1 presents information for the group reporting sleeplessness that also reported insomnia/sleep difficulties as one of their symptoms. Extrapolating to the U.S. population, 51.2 million Americans, about 21.9%, report this level of sleep disturbance. Figure 1. National Health and Wellness Survey : Sleep Medication Sub-Study. Figure 1: National Health and Wellness Survey... Among the 41.3 million adults aged 65+, 6.3 million report sleeplessness with insomnia/sleep difficulties, or 15.3%. Of the 6.3 million, 1.1 million used an OTC sleep aid, 17.5% of people with symptoms, and 2.7% of the total older adult population (Gross, O'Neill, Toscani, &amp; Chapnick, 2015). Younger and older adults differed to some degree in reports of sleeplessness in the past 12 months, as shown in Table 1 . Among those with any sleep symptom and also reporting insomnia/sleep difficulties, the groups differed in reports of difficulty falling asleep (74% aged 18–64, 65% aged 65–74, and 62% aged 75+) and waking during the night (52% aged 18–64, 63% aged 65–74, and 63% aged 75+), but not in waking up too early (41% aged 18–64, 39% aged 65–74, and 38% aged 75+). The groups also differed in reports of poor quality sleep, with older adults less likely to report poor quality sleep: 48% aged 18–64, 28% aged 65–74, and 26% aged 75+. Young and old individuals did not differ in OTC or herbal strategies to alleviate sleep problems. In all age groups about half used a prescription, OTC sleep aid, or herbal product. Among those with any sleep symptom and also reporting insomnia/sleep difficulties, about 18% in all three age groups reported use of an OTC sleep aid, and about a third of these reported an OTC product or a supplement. The most commonly used product was an herbal supplement, melatonin, followed by \"Tylenol products\" (which may contain diphenhydramine), and \"Benadryl/diphenhydramine.\" Among older adults with insomnia/sleep difficulties, the most commonly used prescription sleep aid was zolpidem ( Ambien ), followed by trazodone hydrochloride ( Trazodone , an off-label use) and alprazolam ( Xanax , also off-label). While younger and older adults did not differ in reported sleep difficulties or recourse to OTC products, the workgroup was surprised to find major differences in the way the different age groups use OTC sleep aids. Product labeling for diphenhydramine and doxylamine advises patients to stop use and consult a heath care provider if sleeplessness persists for more than 2 weeks. However, a large number of older adults use the medications chronically. Among people taking OTC sleep aids, 21% of people aged 18–64, 37% of people aged 65–74, and 47% of people aged 75+ reported 15+ days use in the prior month. Use of the products for 15 days or more in the past month is considered inappropriate, given that the drug facts label suggests no more than 2 weeks use in a month. Older adults using OTC sleep aids were also more likely to be taking concomitant anticholinergic medications (23%, aged 18–64; 33%, aged 65–74; and 44%, aged 75+) but less likely to use alcohol (76%, aged 18–64; 65%, aged 65–74; and 54%, aged 75+). Still, even this level of alcohol use is a concern, because drug fact labels for diphenhydramine and doxylamine recommend avoiding alcohol while using the products. Differences in OTC Medication Effects in Younger and Older Adults Differences in OTC Medication Effects in Younger and Older Adults Pharmacokinetics of OTC Sleep Aids Data describing the pharmacokinetics of OTC sleep aids are scarce. Available data are limited to diphenhydramine. Because older adults may have slower metabolism and clearance than younger adults, medication half-lives tend to be prolonged, and peak concentrations tend to be higher in older adults. Data suggest this is the case for diphenhydramine as well. An early study reported that diphenhydramine has a half-life of 9.2hr in adults (mean age 31.5 years), rising to 13.5hr in elderly adults (mean age 69.4 years) (Simons, Watson, Martin, Chen, &amp; Simons, 1990). However, another study found the half-life to range from 4.1hr in young adults to 7.4hr in older adults (Scavone, Greenblatt, Harmatz, Engelhardt, &amp; Shader, 1998). A review published in 1986 found a reported half-life range for diphenhydramine from 3.3 to 9.3hr (Blyden, Greenblatt, Scavone, &amp; Shader, 1986). It is important to note that these studies were published in the 1980s and 1990s and did not employ techniques used to establish pharmacokinetic parameters accepted today. Therefore, the actual half-life of these products remains unclear. However, these limited data suggest that some older individuals may be subject to circulating diphenhydramine when they awaken in the morning, which could cause sedation, compromised cognitive function, dizziness, or falls. Additional data evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diphenhydramine and doxylamine are needed, especially in older adults. In particular, age, sex, and food effects need to be studied in the older population taking the medications, as well as the potential effects of accumulation on cognition, falls, and activities such as driving. Efficacy and Safety of OTC Sleep Aid use Decades of use of first-generation antihistamines for the treatment of allergic disorders demonstrate that these agents are sedating. In fact, these agents are often referred to as \"sedating antihistamines.\" However, whether this effect translates into efficacy for treating occasional sleeplessness or chronic insomnia remains unclear. Because diphenhydramine and doxylamine were marketed before the FDA began the OTC drug monograph process in 1972, the drugs were \"grandfathered\" and not subject to the same requirements for randomized placebo-controlled trials that are required today for drugs going through a New Drug Application approval process (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2014). Similarly, the risks and benefits of OTC sleep aids for the treatment of disturbed sleep in elderly adults have not been systematically examined in randomized controlled trials. There are no published controlled trials examining the use of doxylamine for the treatment of sleeplessness. Small controlled trials of diphenhydramine 50mg are available but the results are equivocal. The most positive published trial supporting the use of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid found that diphenhydramine 50mg significantly improved patient reports of disturbed sleep, including sleep latency and reports of feeling more rested the following morning. Patients in the trial also reported that they preferred diphenhydramine to placebo despite experiencing more side effects (Rickels et al., 1983). Other published data using both patient reports and objective measures of sleep, however, are less positive (Morin, Koetter, Bastien, Ware, &amp; Wooten, 2005). This limited efficacy should be considered in light of the negative residual and anticholinergic side effects associated with diphenhydramine use. For example, in a nursing home population, diphenhydramine was associated with significant psychomotor and cognitive function impairments compared with placebo (Meuleman, Nelson, &amp; Clark, 1987). While diphenhydramine improved sleep latency relative to placebo, there were no other significant benefits. Additional concerns about the use of diphenhydramine concern anticholinergic effects. Anticholinergic effects include blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, and risk of increased intraocular pressure in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. According to the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults, first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, should generally be avoided in older adults due to anticholinergic activity (American Geriatrics Society, 2012). Intervening to Address Sleep Disturbance and OTC Sleep Aids: Key Role of Pharmacy Professionals Intervening to Address Sleep Disturbance and OTC Sleep Aids: Key Role of Pharmacy Professionals The workgroup singled out pharmacists as being uniquely positioned to provide education to older adults about OTC sleep aids. They may be the only health care providers who interact with patients regarding these OTC purchases. While consumers can purchase OTC sleep aids without consulting pharmacists, greater involvement of pharmacists at the point of sale may reduce unintentional misuse. One promising approach to enlist pharmacists in this effort is a series of web-based modules to alert pharmacists to the challenges of OTC sleep aid use among older adults. GSA has engaged Silver Market Training Modules ( ) to develop tools to help pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and possibly other health care professionals work with older adults. The workgroup helped Silver Market develop two 25-min modules involving realistic case studies. The modules include pre- and posttests. One module addresses sleep health in old age ( Sleep Health in Older Adults ) and the other challenges associated with OTC sleep aids ( Non-Prescription Sleep Aid Use in Older Adults ). Case studies demonstrate how to address common challenges for older adults with sleep health issues. For example, the latter module features an older adult ( The Worried Well ), who reports she is \"not sleeping as well as I used to\" but upon questioning reveals her nighttime sleep is age-appropriate and daytime function is undisturbed. In Acute Sleep Disturbance , a patient with a clear precipitating factor (recent bereavement), experiences disturbed sleep, and Chronic Insomnia features a patient with frank sleep maintenance insomnia. Pharmacists are counseled to discourage OTC for the first, to consider short-term OTC in consultation with another health care provider for the second, and to refer the third to a health care provider for possible prescription medication. Pharmacists are also guided to interview patients considering use of OTC products. In the case of a patient purchasing or asking for an OTC sleep aid, the pharmacy professional queries the patient about sleep hygiene practices, the nature and duration of the sleep disturbance and other current medication use, both prescription and OTC, including supplements, along with use of alcohol. For the patient considering an OTC sleep aid with known anticholinergic side effects, the pharmacy professional queries the patient about prescription and OTC products with anticholinergic properties that the patient may already be taking. Advocacy for Sleep Health and the Safe and Effective use of OTC Sleep Aids Advocacy for Sleep Health and the Safe and Effective use of OTC Sleep Aids A key challenge for advocates is to ensure that an issue becomes part of a larger, preferably national conversation. A crucial first step for influencing policy is to identify primary and secondary audiences for the issue. The primary audience for advocacy efforts is composed of decision makers with authority to modify or introduce policies (i.e., Congress). Secondary audiences include individuals or groups that can influence decision makers. These audiences include advisors, foundations, professional societies, patient groups, industry, and media. Once audiences are identified, advocates can work to disseminate their messages to these groups. To reach the primary audience, the workgroup presented information on sleep health and OTC sleep aids in November 2014 in a congressional hill briefing sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Aging Committee. To address secondary audiences, summit invitees included representatives from the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, the National Sleep Foundation, the National Council on Patient Information and Education, the American Psychological Association, the National Council on Aging, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the FDA, the American Pharmacists Association, American Automobile Association, National Council on Aging, National Hispanic Aging Council, NIH, and CDC. Finally, the two webinars attracted some 100 participants each from a variety of educational and consumer organizations. Twitter activity extended the reach of these activities. Conclusions Conclusions The GSA workgroup on Sleep Health and Appropriate Use of OTC Sleep Aids in Older Adults addressed three questions. The first was \"What is different about sleep disturbance and OTC sleep aid use among older adults relative to younger adults?\" Our investigation suggests that older adults are not very different from younger adults in the prevalence of sleep disturbance or recourse to OTC medications. Differences between age groups are subtle. For reasons still unclear, older adults use OTC products differently. They are about twice as likely to take them 15 or more days per month, as mentioned earlier, a conservative criterion for inappropriate use. Is this because they are using OTC products to treat chronic insomnia rather than more mild occasional sleep disturbance? If so, why are they not diagnosed with chronic insomnia and receiving appropriate prescription or behavioral therapy? Or, if not insomnia, why the excessive use? Is it because they are taking OTC sleep aids mainly to treat other symptoms, such as pain, or perceive them to be safe to use? Is the impact of drug tolerance a possibility? Or is the misuse unintentional and simply a byproduct of excessive use of many OTC and prescription products? Research to investigate the ways older people use OTC products would shed light on this issue and may suggest ways to reduce inappropriate use among older people, a key goal given concomitant use of medications with anticholinergic effects. Our second question was \"What is different about the activity of OTC sleep aids in older and younger adults?\" Here we are hampered by the absence of current pharmacokinetic studies and limited randomized controlled trials. Still, available evidence suggests the potential for extended exposure due to longer half-lives for diphenhydramine in older people and the potential risk for hangover or next day effects that may increase the risk of falls and impaired neurocognitive function. Finally, we asked, \"Given such differences, what kinds of education or policy changes would increase safe and effective use of OTC sleep aids among older adults?\" The workgroup singled out the pharmacy community as a key player in reducing inappropriate use and promoting safer use of OTC sleep aids. Taking a detailed sleep aid history and using medication profiles from pharmacy data should be consulted. In addition, educational materials will go some way in helping pharmacy professionals and others work with older adults to choose OTC sleep aids wisely. A bigger challenge will be to reconfigure the community pharmacy to support greater consultation with patients and consumers by pharmacists. Workgroup efforts have begun to promote a national dialogue on ways to promote sleep hygiene and reduce inappropriate use of OTC sleep aids and in this way reduce morbidity that may be associated with current products. Newer and more studied treatments, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, are needed to promote better sleep health and outcomes in older adults with sleep disturbances. ",

				"body": "Abstract and Introduction Abstract and Introduction Abstract Aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), and acetaminophen are commonly used. Frequent use of analgesics has been associated with a higher risk of hearing loss. However, the association between duration of analgesic use and the risk of hearing loss is unclear. We investigated the relationship between duration of analgesic use and self-reported hearing loss among 55,850 women in the Nurses' Health Study. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. During 873,376 person-years of follow-up (1990–2012), longer durations of NSAID use (for &gt;6 years of use compared with &lt;1 year, multivariable-adjusted relative risk = 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.15; P for trend &lt; 0.001) and acetaminophen use (for &gt;6 years of use compared with &lt;1 year, multivariable-adjusted relative risk = 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.14; P for trend &lt; 0.001) were associated with higher risks of hearing loss. Duration of aspirin use was not associated with hearing loss (for &gt;6 years of use compared with &lt;1 year, multivariable-adjusted relative risk = 1.01, 95% confidence interval: 0.97, 1.05; P for trend = 0.35). In this cohort of women, longer durations of NSAID and acetaminophen use were associated with slightly higher risks of hearing loss, but duration of aspirin use was not. Considering the high prevalence of analgesic use, this may be an important modifiable contributor to hearing loss. Introduction Hearing loss is common among adults in the United States. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), two-thirds of women in their sixties have hearing loss. [1] Hearing loss can have a significant impact on quality of life; thus, identifying potential modifiable risk factors may help reduce the burden of this condition. [2,3] Aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and acetaminophen are the most commonly used medications in the United States. [4] Previous studies have suggested that use of high-dose NSAIDs or salicylates (aspirin) may be ototoxic. Ototoxicity may be mediated by several different mechanisms, including impariment of outer hair cell function, reduced vascular supply to the cochlea, and inhibition of cyclooxygenase. [5–9] It is hypothesized that depletion of cochlear glutathione by acetaminophen [10] may result in greater susceptibility of the cochlea to noise-induced damage. [11,12] Furthermore, in rodent models, it has been demonstrated that acetaminophen and a metabolite of acetaminophen may cause ototoxicity through oxidative stress mechanisms. [13] In a cohort of younger women, we found that regular use (≥2 days/week) of ibuprofen and acetaminophen was associated with a higher risk of hearing loss. [14] We therefore decided to examine this question in a cohort of older women and determine whether a longer duration of regular analgesic use was associated with the risk of hearing loss. Given the mechanisms by which analgesics are theorized to cause hearing loss, we hypothesized that longer duration of exposure to analgesics would be more likely to result in hearing loss. We investigated the relationship between duration of analgesic use and risk of hearing loss among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I. Methods Methods Study Participants NHS I is an ongoing cohort study of female nurses. In 1976, a total of 121,700 participants who were 30–55 years of age enrolled. Participants were 44–69 years of age in 1990, the baseline year of our study. In the NHS I, questionnaires are administered to the participants every 2 years, with an average follow-up rate of more than 90% of the eligible person-time. The NHS questionnaires are available online. [15] In the Conservation of Hearing Study (CHEARS), an NHS substudy, researchers investigate factors associated with hearing loss in the NHS. On the 2012 long-form questionnaire, the women were asked whether they had a hearing problem, and if so, the age at which they first noticed a change in their hearing. In 2012, a total of 63,966 women answered the long-form questionnaire. Of these women, 47% reported having a hearing problem. Women who reported a hearing problem that began before 1990 (baseline year of the study) and those who reported a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer were excluded from our study because of the potential exposure to ototoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. After applying these exclusion criteria, our study population comprised 55,850 women. Ascertainment of Medication use In 1990 and every 2 years thereafter, women were asked about their average use of aspirin (e.g., Anacin (Insight Pharmaceuticals, Langhoren, Pennsylvania), Bufferin (Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Hyderabad, India), Midol (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany), and Alka-Seltzer (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany)), acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol (McNeil Consumer Healthcare, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania)), and other antiinflammatory medications (e.g., ibuprofen, Naprosyn (Atnahs Pharma, London, United Kingdom), and Advil (Pfizer, Groton, Connecticut)). Specifically, participants were asked, \"On average, how many days each month do you take any of the following medications: acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol); aspirin (e.g., Anacin, Bufferin, Midol, Alka-Seltzer, etc.); other antiinflammatory (e.g., ibuprofen, Naprosyn, Advil)?\" Starting in 2000, participants were asked about their average use of ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey), and Nuprin (Shasun Pharmaceuticals, Chennai, India)). We considered participants who reported using other antiinflammatory analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen, Naprosyn, Advil) between 1990–1999 and ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) between 2000–2012 to be NSAID users. Participants with missing information on analgesic intake over any 2-year questionnaire period were excluded from that time period. Analgesic use assessed in this manner has been associated with colon cancer, [16] renal cell carcinoma, [17] Parkinson disease, [18] hypertension, [19,20] and breast cancer survival. [21] Duration of medication use was derived by assigning 2 years of use to women who reported using the medication 2 or more days/week on average, starting at baseline (1990), and then adding 2 additional years of use for answers in the affirmative on subsequent questionnaires. Women who reported using analgesics less than 2 days/week on average were categorized as participants with \"no regular use\" for that questionnaire cycle. Duration of medication use was categorized as less than 1 year, 1–2 years, 3–4 years, 5–6 years, and more than 6 years. Women who reported \"no regular use\" of analgesics were categorized as having less than 1 year of use. We were unable to ascertain information on duration of use of aspirin, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen before 1990. Ascertainment of Hearing Loss The outcome in the present study was self-reported hearing loss. In 2012, participants were asked, \"Do you have a hearing problem?\" If they answered in the affirmative, they were asked, \"At what age did you first notice a change in your hearing?\" We defined cases of hearing loss as women who reported a hearing problem after 1990. The gold standard for evaluating hearing loss is pure-tone audiometry. From a logistical and financial standpoint, it is challenging to obtain audiograms in such a large cohort. It has been shown in previous studies that compared with hearing loss diagnosed by audiogram, self-reported hearing loss is a relatively reliable indicator of hearing loss. [22–25] In addition, significant associations between other factors and risk of self-reported hearing loss have been observed using this method of assessment in NHS I and NHS II. [14,26–29] Ascertainment of Covariates Covariates were selected based on previously reported risk factors for hearing loss. These factors included age; [1] race; [1] body mass index; [27,30] waist circumference; [27] alcohol consumption; [28,31] intakes of folate, [32] β-carotene, [29] trans fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, [33] β-cryptoxanthin, [29] vitamin A, vitamin B 12 , vitamin C, [29] vitamin E, potassium, [34] and magnesium; [35] physical activity level; [27,36] smoking; [31] diabetes; [37] hypertension; [26] and tinnitus. [38 39] Updated covariate data were obtained from the biennial questionnaires. Dietary intakes (alcohol, folate, vitamin B 12 , vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, vitamin E, trans fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin) were derived from semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires, which are mailed to study participants every 4 years. The validity and reproducibility of the food frequency questionnaires have previously been reported. [40,41] Many of the other covariates used in our models have been shown to be valid measures in this and other similar cohorts. [42–44] Calculation of the Population Attributable Fraction In the event that duration of analgesic use was found to be associated with risk of hearing loss, we calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of hearing loss among women in our study using the method of Bruzzi et al.. [45] This method has been shown to provide valid estimates of the population attributable fraction with multicategory exposures. [46] This calculation is based on the assumption that there is a causal relation. Statistical Analysis All analyses were performed in a prospective manner. Person-time for each participant was assigned based on their responses to questions about aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen use on the 1990 questionnaire and was updated every 2 years subsequently. Participants were censored at the reported onset of hearing loss or cancer diagnosis. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The Anderson-Gill data structure was used to deal with left truncation and time-varying covariates in an efficient manner. [47] To control for confounding by age as finely as possible, we stratified our analysis jointly by age at start of follow-up and calendar year of a given questionnaire cycle. We also tested for possible effect modification of the relationships of use of aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen with age (categorized as &lt;60 years and ≥60 years). Age 60 years was chosen based on the distribution of participant ages and previous studies in which effect modification by age was investigated. Given that analgesic use may be associated with tinnitus, we performed a secondary analysis in which we excluded women who reported onset of tinnitus before onset of hearing loss. P values are all 2-sided, with 95% confidence intervals for all relative risks. SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all statistical analyses. This study was approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board. Results Results At study baseline (1990), the mean participant age was 53.9 (standard deviation, 6.5) years, and the mean participant body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 25.5 (standard deviation, 4.7). At baseline, 16.2% of participants reported regular (≥2 days/week) aspirin use, 11.1% of participants reported regular NSAID use, and 7.9% of participants reported regular acetaminophen use; 8.8% of participants reported regular use of multiple analgesics. Characteristics of participants by duration of aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen use in 2002 (the approximate midpoint of the study period) are shown in Table 1 , Table 2 and Table 3 . Women with longer durations of aspirin use tended to be older, were more physically active, were more likely to be current smokers, and were more likely to have a history of hypertension or diabetes. Women with longer durations of NSAID use tended to have higher body mass indices and waist circumferences, were less physically active, consumed less alcohol, and were more likely to have a history of hypertension or diabetes. Women with longer durations of acetaminophen use tended to have higher body mass indices and waist circumferences, were less physically active, consumed less alcohol, and were more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes. During 873,376 person-years of follow-up, 18,663 incident cases of hearing loss were reported. Increasing duration of regular NSAID use (for &gt;6 years of use compared with &lt;1 year use, multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.15; P for trend &lt; 0.001) and regular acetaminophen use (for &gt;6 years of use compared with &lt;1 year use, multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.14; P for trend &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with higher risks of hearing loss, but increasing duration of aspirin use was not (for &gt;6 years of use compared with &lt;1 year use, multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.05; P for trend = 0.35) ( Table 4 ). Adjusting for body mass index and waist circumference as continuous variables and excluding participants with a history of tinnitus did not significantly change the results. There was no significant effect modification of duration by age (data not shown). Longer durations of aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen use were significantly correlated with increasing frequency of aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen use (Spearman correlation coefficients = 0.61, 0.48, and 0.59, respectively). There was a higher risk of hearing loss among women who reported regular (≥2 days/week) NSAID use (multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.13) and regular acetaminophen use (multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.13) compared with women who reported average use of less than 2 days/week. Regular aspirin use was not associated with risk of hearing loss (multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.05). Regular use of multiple analgesics was also associated with higher risk of hearing loss (for regular use of aspirin, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen compared with no regular use, multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.32) ( Appendix Table 1 ). Assuming a causal relation between analgesic use and hearing loss among women in our study, the population attributable fraction for regular NSAID use was 4.0%, and that for acetaminophen use was 1.6%. The total population attributable fraction for NSAID use and acetaminophen use among women in our study was 5.5%. Discussion Discussion In our large prospective study, longer durations of regular (≥2 days/week) NSAID use and acetaminophen use were associated with higher risks of hearing loss. If this is a causal relation, it suggests that a substantial proportion of hearing loss attributable to use of analgesics is potentially preventable. Ototoxicity is a well-known potential side effect of very high-dose salicylates. [5] Salicylates have been associated with decreased blood flow to the cochlea, impaired outer hair cell motility, and inhibition of the endocochlear potential via alteration of membrane permeability, conductance, and afferent cochlear nerve function. [7,9,48–50] However, use of high-dose aspirin has been uncommon for more than 2 decades. We found no association between duration of regular (≥2 days/week) aspirin use and risk of hearing loss. Data from a previous study in which investigators examined cumulative use of aspirin in our cohort suggested that participants tended to use aspirin at doses within the recommended daily range, [51] which is much lower than the high doses previously described to be associated with hearing loss. To our knowledge, this represents the first published study in which the relationship between duration of aspirin use and risk of hearing loss in women has been prospectively examined. High-dose NSAIDs have been associated with ototoxicity in rodent models and small human case reports. [52] In NHS II, we found that regular use of NSAIDs was associated with a higher risk of hearing loss, and more frequent use tended to be associated with a higher risk. [14] In a prospective study in men, Curhan et al. [53] found a higher risk of hearing loss associated with a longer duration of NSAID use. Previous data have shown that the average use of NSAIDs within the NHS I cohort is, on average, much less than 3.2 g/day, the recommended maximum daily dose. [51] Our data are consistent with these findings and represent the first published study in which the association between duration of NSAID use and the risk of hearing loss in women has been described. Acetaminophen has been hypothesized to decrease levels of cochlear glutathione, which may reduce protection of the cochlea from noise-induced hearing loss. [11,12] In a previous study in men, researchers demonstrated that a longer duration of acetaminophen use was associated with a higher risk of hearing loss. [53] Our data in women are consistent with these findings. Previous data have shown that use of acetaminophen within this cohort is, on average, far less than 4 g/day, the recommended maximum daily dose. [51] To our knowledge, this represents the first prospective study in women to describe the relation between duration of acetaminophen use and the risk of hearing loss. Although the magnitude of the higher risk of hearing loss with analgesic use in our cohort was modest, given the high prevalence of analgesic use, a small increase in risk could have important public health implications. We calculated the population attributable fraction of hearing loss for NSAID and acetaminophen use and, assuming causality, 5.5% of the cases of hearing loss in our cohort could be attributable to NSAID and acetaminophen use. Although limited by the assumption of causality, our estimates serve as an important reminder that small increases in risk associated with common exposures could have potentially important implications on a population level. Our study has limitations. Our cohort comprised mostly older white women. Further investigation is required to examine the associations in other populations. Although we were able to assess duration of analgesic use, our study lacked information on the cumulative amounts of analgesic intake in participants. Analgesic use was self-reported, and we lacked information on duration of use prior to baseline. Given that analgesic use data were based on self-reports, the possibility of misclassification of analgesic use cannot be excluded. However, data in the present study were prospectively collected over 22 years, and information from this and other similar cohorts has been shown to be highly reliable in previous studies. [40,41,44,54] The outcome of our study was self-reported hearing loss. Although pure-tone audiometry is considered the gold standard for diagnosing hearing loss, self-reported hearing loss has been shown to be a reliable indicator of hearing loss. [22–25] Furthermore, in a recent literature review, Chou et al. [55] showed that a single question on perceived hearing loss was almost as accurate as a more detailed questionnaire or portable audiometric device for detecting hearing loss. Misclassification of the age at which participants reported they first noticed a change in their hearing cannot be excluded. In conclusion, longer duration of regular (≥2 days/week) NSAID use and longer duration of regular acetaminophen use were associated with higher risks of hearing loss, but longer duration of aspirin use was not. Considering the high prevalence of analgesic use and the high probability of frequent and/or prolonged exposure in women of more advanced age, our findings suggest that NSAID use and acetaminophen use may be modifiable risk factors for hearing loss.

				"body": "March 31, 2011 — Yet another lot of Tylenol has been recalled by Johnson & Johnson's McNeil division. The latest recall involves one lot -- 34,056 150-count bottles -- of Tylenol 8-Hour Extended Release caplets. The recalled Tylenol 8-Hour Extended release caplets are 150-count bottles with the lot number ADM074 and the UPC code 300450297181. As with its many previous recalls, the latest Tylenol recall is due to a musty or moldy smell. The odor is thought to be caused by trace amounts of the extremely odorous compounds TBA and TCA, produced by the breakdown of a fungicide used to treat wooden pallets on which the products were stored. The company has also added 10 lots of various products, including Tylenol 8-Hour caplets, to its Jan. 14 wholesale-level recall of various Tylenol, Benadryl, Sudafed, Sinutab, and Rolaids products. This recall does not affect products distributed at the retail level. The wholesale recall adds some 717,696 bottles or packages to the Jan. 14 recall: 5 lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain Extended-Release Geltabs (180,288 bottles) 1 lot of Tylenol Sinus (108,336 packages) 1 lot of Tylenol 8-Hour Extended Release (207,288 bottles) 2 lots of Benadryl Allergy Sinus Headache (87,216 packages) 1 lot of Sudafed PE Cold/Cough Multisymptom (134,568 packages) The string of Johnson & Johnson recalls has gone on so long, and involved so many familiar brands, that the company has devoted an entire web site, mcneilproductrecall.com, to the recall.

While Vicodin is the most popularly prescribed opioid in emergency departments, the drug and other hydrocodone combination formulations are under consideration by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for rescheduling from a Schedule III drug to a more tightly regulated Schedule II drug. New York State has already made the change. With Tylenol #3 representing a potentially ideal alternative, researchers sought to compare the 2 drugs — and found existing evidence was scant. \"The reason we conducted this study was because there was very little evidence supporting the superiority of Vicodin over Tylenol with codeine, despite its heavy preference in the emergency department setting,\" said lead author Andrew K. Chang, MD, MS, an associate professor of clinical emergency medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and attending physician at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York. \"There was no significant difference in side effects, [and] our results showed that Vicodin failed to provide superior pain relief compared to Tylenol with codeine.\" The findings underscore that clinicians should consider prescribing Tylenol with codeine instead of Vicodin when discharging nonelderly patients with acute extremity pain from the emergency department, but Dr. Chang noted an important caveat: patients in groups known to not metabolize codeine normally. \"It's important to be aware that there are codeine hypermetabolizers — for example, up to 30% of African/Ethiopians, who rapidly metabolize codeine to morphine and hence can develop respiratory depression and even death,\" he cautioned. \"At the same time there are some patients who cannot metabolize codeine at all, and hence receive no analgesic effect.\" The study — which did not receive outside funding — was presented here at the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) 30th Annual Meeting. Opiate-Naive Patients For the double-blind study, Dr. Chang and his colleagues randomly assigned nonelderly, opiate-naive emergency department patients who had presented with acute traumatic extremity pain to a 3-day supply of hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/500 mg; n = 88) or codeine/acetaminophen (30/300 mg; n = 93). The researchers contacted the patients a median of 26 hours after discharge and asked for their 0 to 10 numeric rating scale pain scores just before and 2 hours following the most recent ingestion of the drug. They found that the pain score before the most recent dose of pain medication was the same for both groups: 7.6. A high pain score was expected as that would prompt patients to take the prescribed pain medication. Patients reported the mean decrease in the pain scores 2 hours after pain medications to be 3.9 in the hydrocodone/acetaminophen group and 3.5 in the codeine/acetaminophen group, for a between-group difference of only 0.4. \"Both medications decreased pain scores by approximately 50%,\" the authors write. \"However, hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Vicodin [5/500]) failed to provide clinically or statistically superior pain relief compared to codeine/acetaminophen (Tylenol#3 [30/300]).\" Adverse events, mainly drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea, were not clinically or statistically different between the groups, the authors note. The study also is being published in the March issue of Academic Emergency Medicine . The authors noted that they found just 1 other trial , from the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, comparing the 2 drugs in an emergency setting. That study also showed no significant difference in the mean or median pain scores between 2 groups of patients taking either of the medications over 48 hours following ED discharge for acute musculoskeletal pain. \"It was surprising to find so few studies comparing hydrocodone/acetaminophen to codeine/acetaminophen for acute pain, including in the emergency department setting,\" Dr. Chang said. \"I think the reason for this is that in general, emergency physicians have the impression that Tylenol with codeine is a far inferior pain medication when compared to Vicodin.\" \"Impressions are not evidence-based, however, and our study questions that long-standing belief,\" he said. Deep-Seated Perceptions Andre P. Boezaart, MD, agrees that Vicodin's popularity over other alternatives is largely a matter of deep-seated physician perceptions. \"My personal opinion is that this is purely a marketing and cultural issue,\" said Dr. Boezaart, professor of anesthesiology and orthopedic surgery in the Division of Acute and Peri-operative Pain Medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville. \"[Vicodin] is marketed in the US as a serious drug that one uses for serious pain. Common perceptions meanwhile suggest that Tylenol is a safe and mild drug given to children with fevers and colds and used for mild headaches, and is not a serious drug to use for real pain,\" he told Medscape Medical News . Patients with acute pain who learn they are receiving Tylenol may have the impression that they are not being treated with a true pain medication, Dr. Boezaart said. \"We experience this every day when we prescribe the very effective [every 6 hours] scheduled [intravenous] Tylenol 1000 mg to patients with severe acute pain,\" he said. \"Patients will be quick to tell you that their pain is real and will not respond to a mild drug like Tylenol.\" For that reason, Dr. Boezaart suggested that the name \"Tylenol\" even be dropped from the formulation of codeine and acetaminophen and replaced with something else. \"The company manufacturing Tylenol #3 would do the population a great favor if they changed the name to something that does not contain the word 'Tylenol,' but something that suggested treatment for serious pain, and then actively market it for that purpose.\" In the absence of a name change, studies such as Dr. Chang's can help establish the drug's efficacy in comparison with its more popular competitor, Dr. Boezaart said. \"This is certainly the first study that I am aware of that compares Vicodin (5/500 mg) with Tylenol (30/300 mg),\" he said. \"Every instinct would dictate that the latter should be a safer choice, but only further studies like this one by Chang et al would clarify this claim.\"   The study did not receive funding. Dr. Chang and Dr. Boezaart have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) 30th Annual Meeting. Abstract 163. Presented March 8, 2014. Acad Emerg Med .

				"body": "May 3, 2010 — Manufacturing defects have led to the recall of 43 child and infant liquid formulations of Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec, and Benadryl by McNeil, a division of Johnson & Johnson. No injuries or deaths have yet been reported. The voluntary recall follows an April 19 FDA inspection of a McNeil plant in Fort Washington, Pa. that uncovered \"manufacturing deficiencies,\" the Washington Post reports. The company says the chances of injury from one of the recalled products are \"remote.\" Yet consumers are warned not to use the recalled products. \"Some of the products included in the recall may contain a higher concentration of active ingredient than is specified; others may contain inactive ingredients that may not meet internal testing requirements; and others may contain tiny particles,\" a company news release states. If children who have taken the recalled products have unusual symptoms, parents are urged to contact a health care professional. Parents should not give children adult formulation of the medications. Alternative brands of the products, including generic medications, are available. Parents who have questions about alternative treatments should consult their child's pediatrician. Recalled products may be returned for a refund or exchanged for a fresh product once manufacturing issues have been resolved. McNeil did not say how many units were being recalled, but the number likely is huge. Recalled products were distributed in the U.S., Canada, Dominican Republic, Dubai (UAE), Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad & Tobago, and Kuwait.

				"body": "Abstract and Introduction Abstract and Introduction Abstract Background: Joint pain caused by acute osteoarthritis (OA) is a common finding in the emergency department. Patients with OA often have debilitating pain that limits their function and ability to complete their activities of daily living. In addition, OA has been associated with a high percentage of arthritis-related hospital admissions and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Safely managing OA symptoms in these patients can present many challenges to the emergency provider. Objectives: We review the risks and benefits of available treatment options for acute OA-related pain in the emergency department. In addition, evidence-based recommendations will be made for safely managing pain and disability associated with OA in patients with comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding. Discussion: Commonly used treatments for OA include acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids, each with varying degrees of efficacy and risk depending on the patient's underlying comorbidities. Effective alternative therapies, such as topical preparations, intra-articular corticosteroid injections, bracing, and rehabilitation are likely underused in this setting. Conclusions: Emergency providers should be aware of the risks and benefits of all treatment options available for acute OA pain, including oral medications, topical preparations, corticosteroid injections, bracing, and physical therapy. Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common problem, the incidence of which is increasing every day. [1] By 2030, as much as 25% of the adult population is expected to have self-reported or physician-diagnosed arthritis. [2] The prevalence of OA in the ambulatory care setting is approximately 3500 per 100,000 visits, where patients present most commonly with pain related to their knee, hip, and shoulder OA. [3] The primary objective of the emergency provider is to rule out critical diagnoses, such as septic arthritis, fractures, and dislocations. Once this has been accomplished, however, there is still much to be done! Quality of life for this population can be dismal because of their pain. [4,5] Beyond that, OA of the knee and hip joints in an ambulating population can predispose them to falls, potentially leading to intracranial hemorrhage, fractures, and other emergency conditions. [6–8] How is pain and disability best managed in patients presenting with an acute exacerbation of their OA from the perspective of the emergency clinician? This article will provide evidence-based recommendations to help relieve pain and suffering, minimize disability, and prevent future injury in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an acute exacerbation of OA. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology Epidemiology and Pathophysiology There has been a significant increase in the prevalence of OA over the last 20 years, often attributed to the aging population and obesity. [9] OA can be found in up to 13.9% of adults &gt;25 years of age and 33.6% of adults ≥65 years of age. [1] Perhaps more relevant in the ED, patients with OA are more likely to be admitted, have longer hospital stays, and be readmitted when compared to a similar population without OA. [10] Patients with OA also have a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to the general population and an increased level of risk that is independent of treatment complications, such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [11,12] The origin and progression of OA is multifactorial, including genetic predisposition, previous injuries to the joint, and other biomechanical factors. [13] Many definitions for OA exist and are based on pathologic, clinical, or radiographic features, with radiographic being the most prevalent. The specifics of these classifications are complex and beyond the scope of this article. In general, OA represents degenerative changes to articular cartilage, synovium, subchondral bone, and other structures. Not surprisingly, OA symptom severity often correlates with the degree of radiographic abnormality. [14,15] An acute flare of OA commonly presents as increased pain, often associated with joint swelling, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. An acute increase in OA-related pain might be the result of trauma, overuse, or crystal formation. Many patients claim that weather changes influence their OA pain, which is supported by limited evidence. [16,17] The pathogenesis of pain in OA is complex and not clearly understood. Hyaline cartilage is avascular and not innervated by nociceptive receptors, so this is unlikely to be the source of symptoms. The sensation of discomfort is much more likely to come from synovitis, subchondral bone changes, and osteophyte formation; however, OA-related pain can be elicited over apparently normal tissue. [18,19] This would indicate the possibility of central modulation of nociceptive input from the region around an arthritic joint. [19] Despite this limited understanding, several treatment options are available to the emergency provider that have shown efficacy in safely managing pain, function, and disability in patients with OA. Discussion Discussion Oral Pharmaceutical Therapy for Osteoarthritis Acetaminophen. A common initial choice in the management of patients with OA, acetaminophen (APAP) is thought to cause pain relief through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system and peripheral blockade of pain impulse generation. [20] APAP has previously shown efficacy superior to placebo in treating hip and knee OA, with a number needed to treat somewhere between 4 and 16, but not superior to NSAIDs in a 2006 Cochrane review. [21] Another more recent review found that APAP is not helpful in the treatment of low back pain and provides minimal short-term benefit in patients with OA. [22] In 2013, because of a lack of significant benefit over placebo, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) downgraded their guidance on the use of APAP in patients with OA of the knee to inconclusive, and no longer recommend for or against its use. [23,24] There is also evidence that unintentional overdoses of APAP occur in the elderly population and can ultimately lead to multiorgan failure and death. [25] In fact, in 2011, Johnson and Johnson's McNeil Division (the manufacturer of Tylenol) changed the recommended maximum dose from 4000 mg per day to 3000 mg per day because of concerns regarding combination medications and unintentional overdose. [26] While APAP is an option for the treatment of OA, it is unlikely to be as effective as other available alternatives and is not without risk. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs. NSAIDs provide analgesia and reduce inflammation by preventing the synthesis of thromboxanes and prostaglandins through inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes. [27] These medications are generally divided into two categories: nonselective inhibitors and those that primarily inhibit the COX-2 enzyme. The efficacy of NSAIDs in patients with OA has been clearly shown, making NSAIDs one of the mainstays of treatment with a number needed to treat between 1.6 and 3. [28,29] Nonselective NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, as well as COX-2 selective NSAIDs, including meloxicam and celecoxib, provide improvement in pain, function, and mobility. [30] There is no evidence that the short- or long-term use of NSAIDs leads to significant changes in the progression of OA. [31,32] COX-2 inhibitors are as effective as nonselective NSAIDS, more effective than APAP, and cause fewer GI complications. [33] However, COX-2 selective medications tend to be more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs and are best used in patients with an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and GI bleeding. As many providers are aware, NSAIDs do not come without risks. GI bleeding, acute renal injury, and cardiovascular disease are all well recognized complications of taking NSAIDs. Despite these limitations, NSAIDs are a valuable tool in the treatment of OA. When used correctly, they can provide significant relief to the patient presenting to the ED with OA-related pain. All NSAIDs should be given at the lowest effective dose to provide the greatest benefit with the least amount of risk. [30] GI Side Effects and Prevention. One of the most concerning potential side effects of NSAID use is injury to the upper GI tract. More than 7000 deaths and 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States each year are attributed to GI bleeding or perforation from NSAID use. [34] This risk can be significant even with short-term (≤1 month) use, especially in the elderly population, with an increased relative risk of 7.2. [35] The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has identified multiple factors that increase the risk of GI injury from NSAID use ( Table 1 ). [36] The ACG has also provided excellent guidance on how to risk-stratify patients for determining how NSAIDs should be used with gastroprotective medications. High-risk patients have a history of a complicated ulcer or more than two risk factors. Patients at moderate risk have one to two risk factors, and low-risk patients have no risk factors. [36] These categories are further divided by the ACG based on whether or not the patient is taking a daily low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. Table 2 shows the ACG recommendations for the use of NSAIDs based on GI and cardiovascular risk. Gastroprotective medications include proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and misoprostol. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists, such as famotidine, are superior to placebo but significantly less effective than proton pump inhibitors. Misoprostol is effective in preventing ulcers, but may be limited by the side effects of abdominal pain and diarrhea. [36] Cardiovascular and Renal Effects. All NSAIDs appear to increase the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular disease, although naproxen appears to be the least harmful. [37] Even short-term use (7–10 days), as expected from the ED, shows an increased risk of adverse events. [38] These risks increase with higher doses. Naproxen causes the least amount of cardiovascular side effects, and therefore its use is recommended in patients who are taking prophylactic low-dose aspirin as noted in the ACG guidelines. [39] The nonselective NSAIDs, excluding diclofenac, block the antiplatelet effects of aspirin, whereas COX-2 inhibitors do not. [40,41] To prevent these potential medication interactions, aspirin should be given at least 2 hours before any nonselective NSAID. Both classes of NSAIDs can lead to increased plasma potassium concentration and decreased renal function in patients who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. [42] The risk of acute kidney injury appears to increase with combination drug therapy, specifically NSAIDs added to diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. [43] This increased risk ratio was 1.31 relative to patients only taking one antihypertensive combined with NSAIDs. Opioids. Opioid pain medications, not including tramadol, have a modest effect on OA-related pain but put patients at higher risk for adverse events. A Cochrane review from 2014 showed a pool risk ratio of 1.49 for any adverse event and 3.35 for serious adverse events. [44] In an elderly population, opioid pain medication has been shown to increase the risk of fractures and all-cause mortality compared to NSAIDs. [45] Higher doses of opioids lead to a higher risk of fracture risk. [45,46] These same studies note an increased risk of GI bleeding with opioids compared to COX-2 inhibitors. Tramadol, a weak opioid that also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has a small but significant effect on OA-related pain. [47] It also is effective as an add-on therapy for patients who are already taking NSAIDs. [48,49] In patients with OA, tramadol has a number needed to treat for moderate clinical improvement of 6 and a number needed to harm of 8 for adverse effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and headache. [49] Caution should still be taken because elderly patients who are taking tramadol have a higher fracture risk than the general population, and may even have a similar fall risk to that found with other opioids. [50,51] Overall, the published literature supports the use of tramadol over traditional opioids for acute OA-related pain relief. Corticosteroid Injection Therapy Corticosteroids are often used in orthopedic, sports medicine, and primary care clinics to provide relief for various sources of musculoskeletal pain. Depending on the etiology of the patient's pain, they can be administered around tendons or intra-articularly. In the case of symptomatic OA, injections are typically placed in the intra-articular space. The most likely location for this to be considered in the ED is the knee (because it is the most common location of OA), although glenohumeral, femoroacetabular, and carpometacarpal locations may be considered, depending on the situation. [52–55] Systematic reviews show a clinically significant reduction in OA-related knee pain, but not function, within 1 week after corticosteroid injection with a number needed to treat of 3 to 4. [56,57] These reviews also show a superior effect for triamcinolone compared to other injectable corticosteroids. It is important to note that the pain relief experienced by a patient that responds to the injection can be expected to last approximately 4 to 6 weeks. [58] This pain relief is significant, especially in an elderly patient who is already at risk of falling and in whom a narcotic pain medication could lead to a debilitating injury. [59] One potential concern in administering intra-articular steroids is their effect on the surface of the joint—and, in addition, the effect of the coadministered anesthetic. However, several studies have shown no clear association between intra-articular corticosteroid injections and joint degeneration, including some studies that involved patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving as many as 10 injections per year. [60–62] There is some evidence, at least in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, that the suppression of inflammation by these injections may actually protect the joint. [63] A local anesthetic, typically lidocaine, is often coadministered with the corticosteroid for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In vitro studies have shown significant damage to chondrocytes with prolonged exposure to these anesthetics. [64,65] There is also some evidence to suggest that even short-term exposure to local anesthetics is toxic to chondrocytes. [66,67] In spite of this evidence, there is no definitive in vivo data to suggest that a single dose of local anesthetic would lead to any long-term cartilage damage, and providers should consider the addition of a local anesthetic as indicated for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The dose of triamcinolone most commonly cited in OA of the knee is 40 mg intra-articularly, administered no more often than every 3 months. [61,68] This time period deserves special consideration in patients who are scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty. Recent evidence suggests that intra-articular corticosteroid injections may increase the risk of postoperative infection, and ED providers should therefore have a discussion with an orthopedic expert before injecting this patient population. [69] The intra-articular knee injection—likely the most common intra-articular injection to be used in the ED—can be safely and effectively approached in most patients using a seated technique. After appropriate skin preparation using betadine or other sterile preparation, the needle is placed just lateral to the patellar tendon and directed toward the center of the joint space, at roughly a 45° angle medial to the skin (Figure 1). The needle is then advanced into the intra-articular space posterior to the patellar tendon. There should be little resistance to both advancing the needle and to the actual injection of medication. No bone or cartilage should be contacted with this approach. Figure 1. Location and positioning for anterolateral approach of an intra-articular knee injection. Figure 1: Location and positioning for anterolateral approach of an intra-articular knee... It is important for both the provider and the patient to understand the potential risks and benefits of a corticosteroid injection. Diabetics can expect impaired glucose control and should monitor their glucose levels closely for up to 4 days. [70] Injections near the surface of the skin may cause fat atrophy and hypopigmentation. [71] Intratendinous or peritendon injections increase the risk of tendon rupture. [72,73] Infection is a risk any time an intra-articular procedure is performed. For intra-articular injections, historical infection rates are as low as 6 in 100,000 people. [74] The contraindications to corticosteroid injections include cellulitis at the injection site, known allergy or hypersensitivity to the corticosteroid, and septic arthritis. Some cases may present with features that are concerning for septic arthritis. In these cases, the emergency provider should aspirate intra-articular fluid first and obtain testing for features of infection before injecting a corticosteroid. While this process requires two separate intra-articular procedures, it avoids the inappropriate injection of steroids into an infected joint. Other Therapy Options Topical NSAIDs. Oral NSAIDs have long been the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy in patients with OA. As discussed above, these medications can carry cardiovascular, renal, and GI risks that must be considered. Another excellent option—especially for patients who are at high risk for complications with oral NSAID use—is a topical NSAID. Topical formulations have shown significantly lower risk when compared with oral NSAIDs. [75–77] In the United States, several topical NSAID preparations are available for treating OA-related pain, including diclofenac sodium 1% gel (Voltaren Gel; Endo Pharmaceuticals, Malvern, PA), diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% in 45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Pennsaid; Mallinckrodt, Inc., Saint Louis, MO), and diclofenac epolamine 1.3% (Flector Patch; Alpharma Pharmaceuticals LLC, Piscataway, NJ). [78] These medications have shown the ability to improve symptoms and quality of life comparable to oral NSAIDs, with a number needed to treat of 6. [79–81] Topical NSAIDs are typically more expensive in the United States than oral formulations and may cost between $50 and $300 for a full course of treatment, depending on the product. This may be prohibitive to some patients. Topical NSAIDs appear to be the most efficacious for hand and knee OA. [82] The AAOS and American College of Rheumatology consider topical NSAIDs to be first-line options for the treatment of OA of the knee. [83] In general, topical preparations provide a safe and effective alternative to oral NSAIDs, especially in those that are at higher risk of adverse effects. Other Topical Agents. Topical treatment of OA is not limited to NSAIDs. Topical capsaicin can be considered for the knee and hand, and may be effective for up to 20 weeks. [25] Of note, however, is the fact that topical capsaicin does increase the risk of skin irritation local to the site of application. [84] The transdermal 5% lidocaine patch may also be a reasonable option for patients with an acute exacerbation of knee OA. [85] Glucosamine. Studies have found glucosamine to be safe but largely ineffective for pain relief. [86,87] However recent research indicates it may have an impact on the progression of OA. [88] In spite of this, glucosamine has limited utility in the treatment of patients who present to the ED for the treatment of acute joint-related pain. Heat and Cold Therapy. Cold therapy improves range of motion, function, and strength compared to heat and placebo. [89] There is even some concern that elevated intra-articular temperatures through heat application may increase damage to the inflamed arthritic joint. [90] Cold therapy should be recommended over heat in acute OA-related complaints. Bracing and Physical Therapy. Several types of bracing are available, from simple sleeves and cockup wrist splints to complex valgus knee braces. Flexible knee sleeves, made from cotton, neoprene, nylon, or other materials, can provide pain relief and possibly improve balance in patients with OA of the knee. [91,92] Prefabricated and custom splints can reduce pain and disability in patients with carpometacarpal OA. [93,94] Patients with OA generally benefit from range of motion and strengthening exercises. [95,96] Complete immobilization should be reserved only for those patients with severe symptoms and should be discontinued as soon as possible, ideally within 5 to 7 days. This must be made clear to the patient, especially those that are unlikely to have follow-up appointments within 1 to 2 weeks. Physical therapy has been shown to be of significant benefit in many types of OA. [97–99] Unfortunately, it is uncommon and often impractical for the emergency clinician to provide a direct referral to physical therapy or other rehabilitation service. In spite of this, it is important that the emergency provider explain the benefits of therapy to the patient verbally and through discharge instructions so that they may pursue such treatment via other avenues, mainly their primary care provider. If the emergency clinician has the ability to directly refer these patients to therapy or rehabilitation services it should be seriously considered, especially in those patients who have presented to the ED multiple times with the same OA-related complaint. Putting It All Together Putting It All Together The first step in evaluating a patient presenting to the ED with an acute or chronic complaint of joint-related pain is to evaluate for an emergent condition. The differential diagnosis includes septic arthritis, fracture, gout, and tendon or ligament injury. Once these or other concerning conditions have been ruled out and the clinician plans to treat the patient for an acute or chronic exacerbation of OA, the next step in determining the safest and most effective treatment is to determine the patient's level of GI and cardiovascular risk (Figure 2). When indicated, oral NSAIDs should always be given at the lowest effective dose; opioid medications, preferably tramadol, should only be used in circumstances when no other reasonable options are available. Topical therapy is an effective treatment option for knee- and hand-related complaints. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are a safe alternative for many cases of acute OA-related pain, especially in the knee, and should be considered. When feasible, rehabilitation or physical therapy referral should be exercised in this patient population. Figure 2. Algorithm for managing osteoarthritis in the acute setting. NSAID = Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PPI = proton pump inhibitor; UGIB = upper gastrointestinal bleed. Figure 2: Algorithm for managing osteoarthritis... Conclusion Conclusion Through careful selection from the many treatment options available, the emergency clinician can provide safe and effective pain relief without added risk to the patient presenting to the ED with an acute exacerbation of OA.

				"body": "By Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) Feb 17 - Johnson & Johnson said it was recalling its entire U.S. supply of infant Tylenol after parents complained about problems with a new dosing system, the latest in a string of recalls for the healthcare giant. Friday's recall involves about 574,000 bottles of the grape-flavored liquid Tylenol for infants younger than 2 years old. Following earlier recalls, J&J had just returned to the market with the infant Tylenol in November, but now will be out of the market for an indefinite time. The problem involves a new bottle design, which was intended to prevent accidental ingestion and ensure accurate dosing. But when parents inserted a syringe into the bottle, some accidentally pushed a protective cover inside. To date, J&J has received 17 complaints, company spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs said. No serious side effects from the infant Tylenol have been reported, and the risk of such problems are \"remote,\" J&J said. The recall is from stores and wholesalers; consumers can still use the product provided that the protective cover at the top of the bottle remains in place, J&J said. The recall does not affect Tylenol for children 2 years and older, for which J&J also introduced a new but different design. The company had said last summer that it was planning to return its products to the market with the improved designs. J&J spokeswoman Jacobs said the company did not have a specific date for when it would return to the market with infant Tylenol. \"We are looking for various alternatives for the redesign,\" Jacobs said. \"Once we have reviewed those options, we will set a timeline for the product to return.\" The product was manufactured to specifications, so the company is investigating why it was not performing as expected, Jacobs said. Jacobs said the company would only make note of a financial impact from the recall when it reports quarterly results, but that infant Tylenol was a \"relatively modest\" portion of overall sales. The recall is the latest in a long series for J&J, including not only popular consumer medicine brands such as Tylenol, but also artificial hips and contact lenses. The infant Tylenol product was manufactured at a plant in Latina, Italy. Last March, U.S. health authorities took over supervision of three other J&J manufacturing plants after the flood of recalls.

				"body": "ORLANDO, Florida — For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, preoperative opioid use is a red flag for postoperative opioid use and surgical complications, according to new research. If a patient is taking narcotics preoperatively, \"they could be at risk for being on opiates much longer and be more likely to have complications,\" said Robert Westermann, MD, from the Department of Orthopedics at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. \"Narcotic use can be dangerous. We need to understand how much to give and why we're giving it,\" he told Medscape Medical News . Initiatives that encourage orthopedic surgeons to decrease the use of opioids are needed, he said. \"The United States consumes 99% of the world's supply of hydrocodone and 83% of the world's supply of oxycodone,\" Dr Westermann reported here at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons 2016 Annual Meeting. \"In other countries, people go home on Tylenol 3,\" he said. Dr Westermann and his colleagues identified 112,569 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty from 2007 to 2014 in the Humana Inc. administrative claims dataset. Of these patients, 44.0% had no history of opioid use; however, 31.2% filled at least one opioid prescription in the 3 months before surgery, and 24.8% filled at least one prescription more than 3 months before surgery. More presurgery opioid users than nonusers had filled an opioid prescription at 1-month follow-up (83.2% vs 52.1%), and at 12-month follow-up, the difference was significant (24.0% vs 2.7%). The researchers identified patient comorbidities and 90-day complication rates using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. They found that patients who filled an opioid prescription in the 3 months before surgery were more likely than nonusers to have medical comorbidities like diabetes kidney or coronary artery disease (average Charlson Comorbidity Index, 3 vs 2; P  < .05). Across the board, 90-day complication rates were higher in presurgery opioid users than in nonusers. Table. 90-Day Postoperative Complications Complication Presurgery Opioid Users, % Nonusers, % P Value Pulmonary embolus 1.75 1.71 .6911 Deep vein thrombosis 4.07 3.86 .1155 Acute myocardial infarction 0.85 0.81 .6051 Respiratory failure 4.75 4.05 <.0001 Catheter-associated urinary tract infection 0.04 0.04 .9056 Pneumonia 2.73 2.37 .0006 Acute renal failure 4.38 3.69 <.0001 Cerebrovascular event 2.44 2.30 .1794 Acute cholecystitis 0.19 0.23 .1327 Infection requiring surgery 1.25 0.70 <.0001 Surgical-site infection 4.00 2.90 <.0001 Revision total knee arthroplasty 0.73 0.41 <.0001   \"We hope to do further research to see whether complication rates will come down if opiate users stop taking medication before surgery,\" said Dr Westermann. A separate study presented at the meeting did just that. Researchers looked at 41 opioid users who reduced their use by 50% 6 weeks before either a total knee or total hip arthroplasty. These patients were matched with 41 opioid users who did not cut back before surgery and 41 patients who were not using opioids. The results showed that complication and infection rates during the 90 days after surgery were comparable in the opioid users who cut back and the nonusers. \"We wanted to look at the effect of dose,\" said David Sing, a clinical research associate at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Patients who weaned had higher physical function and better final scores.\" In the group that didn't wean, there was a 7.5-fold increase in opioid use after surgery. \"That shows us they have a reduced pain tolerance,\" he told Medscape Medical News . Sing said they weaned patients by counseling and tapering use every week until they reached their target. It's definitely a modifiable risk that can be managed, and more can be done, he explained. \"There are pain specialists out there whose main clientele are opioid-dependent people. They can provide a more holistic approach to addressing addiction.\"   Most patients expect that when they walk into a physician's office, they'll leave with either a brace or a pain medication prescription.   \"It's a hard sell now. Most patients expect that when they walk into a physician's office, they'll leave with either a brace or a pain medication prescription,\" said John Martell Jr, MD, chief of orthopedic surgery at the VA North Texas Health Care System in Dallas. \"Sometimes it's better if they leave with advice instead of that wonder pill,\" he said. Currently, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, but does not offer an opinion on opioid use. \"Opioids do pretty poorly with musculoskeletal pain,\" said Dr Martell told Medscape Medical News . \"Anti-inflammatories actually work better.\" One study demonstrated that opioids have a minimal effect on pain and physical function for patients with osteoarthritis, and revealed that evidence of their effectiveness and safety is contradictory ( Cochrane Database Syst Rev . 2014;9:CD003115 ). But as an orthopedic surgeon, it can be difficult to convince patients, Dr Martell reported. By the time surgeons see patients, primary care providers have often already convinced them that they need pain narcotics. Traditional methods of dealing with pain are often the best. \"Sometimes I think we should just go back to the good old days and tell patients to use ice,\" he explained. Dr Westermann and Dr Martell have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2016 Annual Meeting: Poster 161. Presented March 1, 2016. ",

				"body": "In a \"guidance to industry\" document issued August 4, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed the use of flow restrictors for over-the-counter (OTC) pediatric oral liquid drug products containing acetaminophen. \"OTC pediatric oral liquid drug products containing acetaminophen have been associated with overdoses due to medication errors that resulted in serious adverse events, including severe liver damage and death, the FDA notes in the document . This guidance is designed to help \"drug manufacturers, packagers, and labelers minimize the risk to consumers of acetaminophen-related liver damage\" associated with use of these products. Specifically, the FDA recommends adopting \"container features designed to improve safety by potentially contributing to more accurate dosing and helping to reduce the incidence and magnitude of accidental acetaminophen ingestion by children, such as an appropriate flow restrictor contained in the opening of the immediate container.\" \"If a flow restrictor is included, it should be attached to the container in a way that prevents it from being pushed into the bottle or easily removed. Firms are encouraged to discuss innovative containers/packaging features with FDA before introduction into the market,\" the FDA says. Flow-restrictors fit onto the top of a bottle to guard against children inadvertently squeezing or sucking out too much of the liquid medicine, the investigative news organization ProPublica notes on their website . While the FDA guidance does not require use of the devices, \"it is a strong signal to manufacturers that flow restrictors are considered an important safety feature to help reduce accidental overdoses,\" the organization notes. \"This is definitely significant,\" Daniel S. Budnitz, MD, MPH, from the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, told ProPublica. Each year in the United States, roughly 10,000 children are seen in emergency departments because of overdosing on liquid medicines, many of them containing acetaminophen, according to Consumer Reports . The FDA guidance comes 20 months after ProPublica and Consumer Reports reported on the flow restrictors, which have been shown to reduce the liquid dose that children can accidentally remove from a bottle, ProPublica says. In 2011, a month before an FDA panel was set to discuss the use of flow restrictors, pharmaceutical industry representatives announced that they would voluntarily begin adding flow restrictors to infants' and children's pediatric medicine bottles, led by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson & Johnson unit that makes Tylenol, ProPublica says. Consumer Reports recently tested flow restrictors on more than 30 liquid infant acetaminophen bottles found on drugstore shelves. While all of them did make it harder for kids to consume the liquid, some devices worked better than others. Efforts are under way by multiple partners to develop standards to test the efficacy of flow restrictors. Final results are expected to be issued in 2016 by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International, according to ProPublica. \"Still, neither the drug agency nor industry has indicated a willingness to require the flow restrictors for other liquid children's medicines, such as prescription cough medicine. Researchers believe that installing the devices in all kids' liquid medicines might help further reduce accidental overdose,\" ProPublica says. \"It's incremental progress, but it definitely is progress,\" Dr Budnitz told the organization.

				"body": "July 9, 2010 — The recall of Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines has grown once again, with Tylenol maker McNeil PCC Inc. today announcing the recall of 21 lots of medicines as a precautionary measure. Today's recall includes Tylenol of various formulas, including children's Tylenol, the painkiller Motrin, and Benadryl allergy tablets. (To find out if a product you have has been recalled, find the lot number and go to www.mcneilproductrecall.com/page.jhtml?id=/include/prd_all.inc ). Late last year and into 2010, McNeil recalled a total of 60 million products after an abnormal smell was found in some containers. The musty, moldy odor was linked to trace amounts of a chemical called TBA. Today's recall was announced after an internal review found that some package materials used in these lots had been shipped and stored on the same type of wooden pallet tied to the presence of the TBA in the previously recalled lots, according to a news release by McNeil. The lots in today's recall were produced before the Jan. 15 recall. Lots produced after that date weren't in contact with the same type of pallet, which McNeil has stopped using. The chances of becoming ill from using the most recently recalled lots is remote, according to information released by McNeil. People in possession of any of the 21 lots of recalled medicine should stop using it and contact McNeil Consumer Healthcare for instructions on getting a refund or replacement To do so, visit the web site, www.mcneilproductrecall.com, or call 888-222-6036 weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time and weekends, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time.

				"body": "January 18, 2011 — McNeil Consumer Healthcare, which makes Tylenol pain relief drugs, says it is recalling a number of lots of its Tylenol products as well as some lots of Sinutab, Benadryl, and Sudafed PE because the medications were made at a plant where production was suspended in April 2010. McNeil says in a news release posted on the FDA’s web site that the recalled products were made in a Fort Washington, Pa., plant that was closed because of concerns about equipment cleaning procedures. The company says it is voluntarily recalling the products at the wholesale level and that consumers do not need to take any action. The products can still be used by consumers, the statement says. McNeil Recalling Tylenol and Other Products McNeil Consumer Healthcare says it is recalling certain lots of Tylenol 8 Hour, Tylenol Arthritis Pain, and Tylenol upper respiratory products. In addition, it says it is recalling certain lots of Benadryl, Sudafed PE, and Sinutab products that were distributed in the Caribbean and Brazil as well as in the United States. “These products were manufactured at the McNeil plant ... prior to April 2010, when production at the facility was suspended,” the McNeil statement says. “The company is initiating the recall as a precautionary measure after an extensive review of past product records found instances where equipment cleaning procedures were insufficient or that cleaning was not adequately documented.” Company Says Not Likely Recalled Drugs Are Impaired The statement adds that “it is very unlikely that this impacted the quality of these products.” McNeil’s statement says the company also has begun a voluntary recall of certain product lots of Rolaids Multi-Symptom Berry Tablets distributed in the U.S. in order to update the labeling. The labeling does not include the words “does not meet USP” as required by regulation, the statement says. A USP label means the product meets standards of quality, purity, strength, and consistency of the United States Pharmacopeia, a non-governmental authority that sets standards for over-the-counter and prescription medications. Marc Boston, a McNeil company spokesman, says 42,949,736 bottles and packages of Tylenol, Benadryl, Sudafed, and Sinutab are being recalled. Additionally, 3,924,168 bottles, rolls, and packages of Rolaids Multi-Symptom Berry Tablets are being recalled. Quality Control Steps Being Taken by McNeil The company says it has implemented a comprehensive action plan at its U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve quality at those sites. “This product assessment is a key milestone in the implementation of that plan and the actions being undertaken as a result of the assessment are part of McNeil’s ongoing commitment to ensure that all its products meet the high quality standards that consumers expect,” the company statement says. For more information, consumers can visit www.mcneilproductrecall.com or phone McNeil’s consumer care center at 888-222-6036 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time Monday through Friday and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Saturday through Sunday.

				"body": "Using professional in-person or videoconference language interpreters for clinical visits halved the number of clinically important communication mistakes compared with improvised interpretation by family or friends or a nurse or clerk, according to a cross-sectional study published in the November issue of Medical Care . \"Professional [videoconferencing] interpretation in particular seems to be well accepted by patients and may be a cost-effective method for expanding access to professional interpretation services to meet quality standards,\" write Anna M. Nápoles, PhD, MPH, and colleagues from the Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical Effectiveness Research Center for Diverse Populations, University of California, San Francisco. Full use of professional interpretation for patients with limited English proficiency “is a quality of care issue whose time has come,\" they said. The researchers analyzed interpreted transcriptions from 32 audiotaped primary care visits involving 32 Spanish-speaking patients and 14 clinicians at a single primary care clinic. Five of the visits included in-person professional language interpretation, and 22 involved professional videoconference interpretation. The other five visits involved ad hoc interpretation by a family member, friend, nurse, or clerk. Most of the patients were women born in Mexico, nearly all of whom had less than a high school education. More than half had no health insurance, and their mean age was 53 years. Among the clinicians, whose mean age was 51 years, most were white non-Latino women, and half had no training in working with interpreters. Four bilingual experienced data coders, including two behavioral scientists and two general internists, coded and divided the speech into \"text units\" consisting of a segment of continuous speech, and the internists rated the text units' clinical significance as insignificant or mildly, moderately, or highly significant. The most common types of interpretation errors were omissions and preemptive answers. Nearly a third (30%) of the text units included inaccurate interpretation, and these errors occurred twice as often in ad hoc encounters as in the other two sets of encounters with professional interpreters. Whereas 54% of the ad hoc visit text units included errors, 25% of the in-person interpreted visits and 23% of the videoconference interpreted visits had errors. Adjusted odds calculations found that in-person professional interpretation was associated with a significantly lower odds of inaccurate interpretation compared with ad hoc interpretation (odds ratio [OR], 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 - 0.33), as was profession videoconference interpretation (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 - 0.56). Most mistakes were errors of omission (65%), answers for patient or clinician (14%), or substitutions (12%). Among the average 27 errors per visit, 7.1% were deemed moderately or highly clinically significant. Moderately or highly clinically significant errors were significantly less likely with in-person profession interpretation compared with ad hoc interpretation (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06 - 0.99). Among ad hoc interpretations, 4.6% of text units included moderately or highly clinically significant errors compared with 0.8% of professional in-person interpretation and 1.7% of videoconference interpretation. One example of a highly clinically significant error was an interpreter translating that a patient can take two tablets of Tylenol every 4 hours for pain rather than every 6 hours, as the physician instructed. In assessing the quality of the interpretation on a scale ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (high), patients rated videoconference interpretation higher (mean, 4.3) than professional in-person (mean, 3.4) or ad hoc (mean, 3.4) interpretation. High-quality interpretation was defined as \"listening and conveying accurate information and responsiveness to potential barriers to communication.\" Clinician-rated assessments of quality had a mean of 3.4 across all three modes of interpretation. \"Demand for professional interpreter services exceeds availability and will continue to grow,\" the researchers write. \"[Videoconference] offers promise for addressing shortages of professional medical interpretation services, with demonstrated acceptability among patients and clinicians, and preference over telephone interpretation.\" The study findings were limited by lack of randomization, imbalanced sample sizes, old data (recordings were 10 years old), and lack of interpreter identification, which may have accounted for clusters of errors attributed to one person, the investigators note. The research was supported by the California Endowment and the National Institute on Aging. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Med Care . 2015;5:940-947. Abstract ",

				"body": "September 29, 2009 — McNeil Consumer Healthcare is recalling certain lots of Children's Tylenol and Infants' Tylenol after bulk raw material was found to be tainted with B. cepacia bacteria. In a news release, the company says it has implemented the voluntary recall \"at the warehouse and retail levels,\" not at the consumer level. \"The packaged product, shipped to retailers by the company, has met all specifications,\" McNeil Consumer Healthcare states. The recalled products were made between April 2008 and June 2008. In a letter to healthcare professionals, McNeil Consumer Healthcare states that examination of bulk raw material detected the bacteria Burkholderia cepacia ( B. cepacia ). But none of that tainted raw material was used in the production of any finished product; the recall is a precaution, according to McNeil Consumer Healthcare. \"Adverse health consequences of B. cepacia infections could be potentially severe, especially in high-risk patients, such as those with underlying pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or compromised immune systems,\" McNeil Consumer Healthcare states in the letter, which is dated Sept. 18. The company says it has checked its post-marketing data and found no safety signals for Children's or Infants' Tylenol products for the time period related to the recalled batches. The likelihood of a serious medical event is \"remote,\" McNeil Consumer Healthcare states. McNeil Consumer Healthcare advises parents or caregivers to contact their child's health care provider if they have given the product to their child or infant and have concerns. Consumers with questions can also call the company's consumer call center at 800-962-5357 Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time.

				"body": "June 29, 2011 — Johnson & Johnson has announced a recall of 60,912 bottles of Tylenol Extra Strength Caplets because of reports that some containers had an \"offensive\" odor that has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The announcement was made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, one of J&J's companies. McNeil says in a news release that the product was manufactured in February 2009, and that it was recalling the pills following a \"small number\" of reports of a musty, moldy odor. Chemical Causes Unpleasant Odor McNeil said the odor has been linked to the presence of trace amounts of a chemical known as 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA), which is a by-product of a chemical preservative sometimes used on shipping pallets. The company said it was taking the action as a precaution and that the risk of serious adverse medical events is \"remote.\" McNeil Consumer Healthcare said consumers who bought the product from the lot being recalled should stop using it and contact the company on its web site or by calling 888-222-6036. Each recalled bottle contains 225 caplets. The company said the lot number on the product is ABA619 and the UPC code 300450444271. Gastrointestinal Problems In addition to causing unusual, unpleasant odors, TBA has been associated with temporary and non-serious gastrointestinal symptoms. In March 2011, the McNeil division of Johnson & Johnson recalled one lot, or 34,056 bottles, of Tylenol 8-Hour Extended Release caplets due to a musty odor. In April 2011, the company issued a voluntary recall of 57,000 bottles of its epilepsydrug Topamax due to complaints of a foul odor associated with the tablets.

				"body": "January 15, 2010 — Because of a sickening smell in some containers, 54 million packages of 27 different over-the-counter remedies now are being recalled. Products include various types of child and/or adult Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl, St. Joseph Aspirin, Rolaids, and Simply Sleep. This adds to the 6 million packages of Tylenol recalled late last year, bringing the total number of recalled products to 60 million. A musty, moldy odor coming from the products has sickened at least 70 people with nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The symptoms go away by themselves and no one has been seriously injured. The FDA says Johnson & Johnson's McNeil Consumer Health Care knew of the problem for more than a year. When the company did act in November and December 2008, it did too little too late, said Deborah M. Autor, director of the FDA's Office of Compliance. \"When something smells bad, literally or figuratively, companies must aggressively investigate and take all actions necessary to solve the problem,\" Autor said at a news conference. \"McNeil should have acted faster.\" The odor comes from a chemical, 2,4,6-tribromoanisole or TBA. TBA is produced when fungi break down a commonly used fungicide called 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The full health effects of TBA are not known. Before being filled with product, product containers were stored on wooden pallets apparently treated with the fungicide. TBA seems to have infiltrated the product containers before they were filled. The FDA inspected McNeil's main plant at Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and was not happy with what it found. The FDA says McNeil began receiving complaints in May 2008, but failed to investigate fully or to warn consumers in a timely manner. The FDA has given McNeil 15 days to respond to its seven-point warning letter. In addition to the contamination issue, the FDA says there are product-quality issues with some Motrin products. Specific products included in the recall include: Children's Motrin Children's Tylenol Extra Strength Tylenol Regular Strength Tylenol Tylenol 8 Hour Tylenol Arthritis Tylenol PM Benadryl Motrin IB Rolaids Simply Sleep St. Joseph Aspirin A complete list of the recalled products, including package sizes, product types, lot numbers, and UPC codes, can be seen at www.mcneilproductrecall.com.

				"body": "October 19, 2010 — Johnson & Johnson has recalled a Tylenol product because of a musty odor, the sixth in a string of product recall announcements dating back to November 2009. The odor is thought to be caused by a chemical -- 2,4,6-tribromoanisole or TBA -- leached into product packaging by wooden storage palettes. TBA is a pesticide and flame retardant. \"The risk of adverse medical events is remote,\" states a news release by J&J's McNeil Consumer Healthcare division. The recalled product is Tylenol 8 Hour Caplet 50 Count. The recalled product carries these codes: Lot number BCM155 NDC Code 50580-297-50 UPC # 3 0045-0297-51 8 People who bought this product should stop using it and contact McNeil Consumer Healthcare for a refund or product coupon. Adverse events related to the product should be reported to the FDA's Medwatch Adverse Event Reporting Program at 800-FDA-0178. Last January, the FDA issued a warning letter to McNeil, complaining that the firm violated Good Manufacturing Practices by failing to fully investigate consumer complaints of a musty odor in its products. The FDA said the company began receiving complaints in 2008. Last July, J&J/McNeil recalled 21 lots of products because of the musty odor linked to TBA. The July recall included children's Tylenol, Motrin brand ibuprofen, and Benadryl allergy tablets. Previous recalls of McNeil products because of the musty odor were issued in November and December 2009, and in January, June, and July 2010. SOURCES: FDA. News release, McNeil Consumer Healthcare.

				"body": "Four days after an editorial by Jeffrey Drazen, MD, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM ), suggested a plan to allow data sharing was flawed because it could breed research \"parasites,\" Dr Drazen issued a new letter clarifying the NEJM 's position. In the letter, published online January 25, Dr Drazen writes: \"[W]hen appropriate systems are in place, we will require a commitment from authors to make available the data that underlie the reported results of their work within 6 months after we publish them.\" This time, he did not include the word \"parasites,\" saying only that in talking with clinical researchers about the proposal by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), \"Some of them spoke pejoratively in describing data scientists who analyze the data of others.\" He added that researchers who analyze others' data \"can substantially improve human health.\" Vinay K. Prasad, MD, MPH, a hematologist-oncologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland, called it a \"half-hearted statement\" that was short of an apology, but that endorses what he calls only a baby step by the ICMJE. Medscape Medical News previously reported that ICMJE has called for authors to share deidentified individual patient data (IPD) underlying their results no later than 6 months after publication as a condition of their study submission. Dr Prasad pointed to the phrase \"underpinning the results and analysis\" published, and said that wording obligates researchers only to hand over the data that support the conclusion they found, not the data that could lead to other findings. However, he does not think that is enough, he told Medscape Medical News . When a trial involves human beings who have taken a risk by being subjects, he said, a researcher should have to release all of the data: \"[W]hat you think is important and what you think is not important.\" Original Editorial Criticized Proposal The earlier editorial by Dr Drazen and NEJM Deputy Editor Dan Longo, MD, concluded that although clinical trial data sharing is a good and noble idea, there is considerable concern about the details as proposed by ICMJE. Among Dr Drazen's and Dr Longo's main problems with the proposal by the ICMJE is that someone not involved in the original data collection who wants to use the results may misinterpret why the original parameters were chosen. They also note, \"There is concern among some front-line researchers that the system will be taken over by what some researchers have characterized as 'research parasites,' \" either using others' research for their own end or using the data to disprove the original hypothesis. They add that data sharing \"should happen symbiotically, not parasitically,\" and that researchers should identify collaborators who can work with them to further test the hypothesis and have a system of shared authorship. Dr Prasad said, \"History will show this is probably the worst editorial written this year in any journal.\" He argued that using a researcher's data and testing them in a different way from a different perspective is not a threat, but precisely what science needs. Other researchers looking at the data may be able to synthesize data from several studies and draw out themes. Reanalysis may also yield important findings that can be practice changing. \"We had a reanalysis of Tamiflu [Genentech], which was once hailed as a panacea for the flu, and now it's been called almost no better than Tylenol [McNEIL-PPC, Inc],\" he said. (The reanalysis of oseltamivir published in the BMJ has been referenced in Medscape Medical News .) He pointed out, however, that any new interpretation of a researcher's data would still have to undergo peer review. Dr Drazen's editorial sparked passionate replies on social media and on the ICMJE website and inspired hashtags such as #ResearchParasites. 6-Month Rule Too Long or Too Short? Some commented on the ICMJE website and social media that they take issue with the 6-month postpublication timetable, arguing either that it is too long or that it is too short. Michael Hoffman, PhD, scientist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and assistant professor at University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, told Medscape Medical News that \"allowing data embargoes for 6 months after publication is irresponsible.\" \"Researchers can fully exploit data they collect until publication. After that, it must be available for the rest of the scientific community to review and evaluate.\" Science is a team effort, he says, \"but Drazen wants to give extra privileges to one part of the team: clinical trialists such as himself. It's notable that he doesn't suggest gift authorships for those who write the research software or provide the genomic resources critical for many studies.\" Elizabeth Wager, PhD, from the University of Split School of Medicine in Croatia, writes in the ICMJE comments section that although she agrees in general with the idea of data sharing, data should be turned over more quickly: at time of submission. \"While I accept that preparing data for sharing can be time-consuming, I worry that journals will not check whether authors have made the data available within this timeframe. It would be much more effective (although tougher) to require it at the time of publication, since this could easily be checked by the journal,\" she writes. Some Say Proposal Is Short-Sighted Others argue that those in countries or institutions with fewer resources run the risk of their postpublication studies being \"scooped\" because they are not able to complete them as fast as those with more resources. David Saunders from the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, writes that the ICMJE proposal ignores the need for financial compensation. \"I do not agree that this is something that the ICMJE can or should require.... A typical clinical trial costs millions-100s of millions [of dollars] to conduct,\" he writes. \"Requiring investigators to simply give this information away to the general public, and particularly academic competitors could have significant 2nd and 3rd order consequences that must carefully be considered.... A waiver of all publication fees would seem to be a minimal requirement if this were to be enforced.\" He said the requirement to turn over data adds to the growing onerous demands on researchers by regulatory authorities. \"I suspect this would drive at least some authors to seek out new ways of publishing information that 'cuts out the middle man' to leverage the full value of the data and recoup the costs,'\" he writes. The ICMJE will consider feedback before it adopts the new rules. Comments are welcome on the ICMJE website through April 18. New requirements would start with clinical trials that begin to enroll participants beginning 1 year after adoption of the new policy.

				"body": "Mindfulness meditation reduces reported pain significantly more than does placebo, say US investigators, who found that different neural mechanisms are employed by different pain relief interventions. The study of healthy volunteers revealed that although a placebo cream and sham mindfulness meditation significantly reduced experienced pain in response to a thermal stimulus, mindfulness meditation achieved pain reductions significantly greater than both. The findings also showed that the neural mechanisms employed to reduce pain were different for mindfulness meditation and placebo, indicating that there are multiple pathways for pain modulation. \"When compared to the placebo conditions, mindfulness meditation–based pain relief engages multiple mechanisms that are associated with cognitive control, emotion regulation, and reducing the activation of low-level sensory processes,\" lead investigator Fadel Zeidan, PhD, assistant professor of neurobiology and anatomy at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News . \"The findings also show us that mindfulness employs a unique subset of brain regions when compared to the placebo conditions. In a nutshell, these findings provide more evidence that mindfulness meditation is not a pseudo-type of cognitive intervention.\" The research was published November 18 in the Journal of Neuroscience . Durable Effect? The team conducted a series of experiments in which 75 healthy volunteers (mean age, 27 years) were randomly assigned to 4 days of either mindfulness meditation, placebo conditioning, sham mindfulness meditation, or a book-listening control intervention to determine the impact of these interventions on pain. The participants initially completed the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory short form (FMI), after which they underwent psychophysical training in which they were familiarized with the delivery of thermal stimuli of 35º to 49º C for 5 seconds to the left arm via the TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer (Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel). They were also assessed through use of a visual analogue pain rating scale. Participants then underwent MRI of the brain while experiencing either neutral or painful thermal stimuli to the right calf. This was followed by group training/conditioning to one of the interventions. Mindfulness meditation training was administered as one 20-minute session per day for 4 days. Sham meditation consisted of telling participants to close their eyes and take deep breaths. For the placebo, participants were told they were taking part in a trial for a \"topical, local anesthetic\" (petroleum jelly). The control group listened to recordings of a book previously validated as a neutral comparison regime. Again under MRI, participants experienced neutral and painful thermal stimuli either side of a manipulation session, in which the sham and actual mindfulness groups were asked to begin meditating, the placebo group received a topical application of the cream, and the control group was told to keep their eyes closed and not move. The findings revealed that all groups reported significiant changes in pain intensity before and after the manipulation session in response to painful thermal stimuli ( P = .002). This consisted of significant reductions in pain intensity following mindfulness meditation, sham mindfulness, and placebo, and a significant increase in pain intensity following the control intervention. Further analysis indicated that mindfulness mediation was associated with significantly greater reductions in pain intensity and pain unpleasantness vs placebo ( P = .032 and P < .001, respectively). Significant reductions in pain intensity and pain unpleasantness were also seen with mindfulness meditation in comparison with sham meditation ( P = .030 and P = .043, respectively) and with the control intervention ( P < .05 for both). Interestingly, MRI revealed that pain relief following mindfulness meditation was associated with increased activation in brain regions linked to the cognitive modulation of pain, such as the orbitofrontal, subgenual anterior cingulate, and anterior insulate cortex. In contrast, placebo analgesia was linked to activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and deactivation of the secondary somatosensory cortex, which is linked to sensory processing. Sham meditation was associated with reductions in respiratory rate vs other interventions but not with significant changes in neural activity. Discussing the findings, Dr Zeidan said that it is unclear how long the pain relief effect of mindfulness could be expected to last. \"It's really hard to say, and the answer is probably not long. Having said that, in a previous paper , we found that after a 3-day meditation intervention, subjects felt less pain when compared to a control group, even when they were not meditating,\" he said. \"However, in the present study, pain relief was produced during meditation. More data are needed to see if the pain-relieving effect of meditation is produced even when not meditating and how much training is required. I would imagine that that may take more training.\" The place of mindfulness meditation in clinical pain management is also open to debate. \"At this stage, I don't see mindfulness meditation replacing traditional pain therapies,\" Dr Zeidan said. \"However, I do see mindfulness-based therapies as an adjunct tool that can be used in conjunction with other therapies/treatments to reduce medical costs and pharmacologic intervention.\" One of the interesting aspects of the study findings was that sham mindfulness also yielded beneficial effects on pain. Does Dr Zeidan believe that there are aspects of sham meditation that could help to optimize mindfulness for pain management? \"Absolutely! Simply thinking that you were meditating and taking deep breaths produced significant reductions in pain. This is a critical consideration for the development of meditation interventions to specifically target health outcomes. \"Having said that, more research is needed with the sham meditation technique, but we found that there are analgesic mechanisms associated with lowering respiration rate and employing a meditative posture,\" he said. Pain Mechanisms Complex Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News , Madhav Goyal, MD, MPH, from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, described the research as \"interesting.\" \"While they do find that certain regions of the brain are either activated or deactivated more with mindfulness compared with one of the control groups, the issue of what is the mechanism by which we feel less pain is a complex one. \"It is interesting that certain regions of the brain are activated or deactivated in each of the different groups that showed some improvement, suggesting that analgesia works through various mechanisms,\" he said. Dr Goyal noted, however, that the study has \"some limitations.\" \"Very few people would consider three 20-minute sessions of mindfulness as real training in mindfulness.\" Moreover, he questioned the use of the term \"placebo\" as a catch-all word, and wondered whether the nature of the placebo used could have had an impact on the findings. \" 'Placebo' is a generic term for many different ways to trick the brain into thinking it is getting something externally which it actually isn't,\" he explained, adding: \"Different types of placebo can have differing responses: an expensive bitter pill is likely to have a greater analgesic effect than a free sugar pill.\" Dr Goyal questioned whether the results would have been different if \"the investigators had also given a placebo pill instead of the cream that was said to reduce pain.\" There are also other comparisons that could have shed light on the utility of mindfulness in pain management. \"It would have been very interesting to see how their findings compare with treatments that are known to reduce pain, such as Tylenol [acetaminophen] or ibuprofen, or even a narcotic,\" he said. \"How do mindfulness and the placebo conditions compare with those mechanisms?\" Finally, Dr Goyal pointed out that \"the paper seems to imply that the mindfulness group was the most mindful, based on their use of the FMI. \"But all the groups had a similar level of mindfulness on that scale, so that can't be the explanation,\" he said. \"This doesn't detract from the findings, though.\" This work was supported by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health; the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; the Mind and Life Institute Francisco J.

				"body": "ROME — In patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hand, 24 weeks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not ease pain or improve function, new research shows. \"Findings from our trial do not support the prescription of hydroxychloroquine for patients with mild to moderate pain from hand osteoarthritis, neither on a physical nor emotional level,\" Natalja Basoski, MD, from Maasstad Ziekenhuis in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, said in a statement. \"However, further investigations are needed to determine whether hydroxychloroquine relieves pain in other specific phenotypes of hand osteoarthritis,\" she added. The results were presented here at the European League Against Rheumatism Congress 2015. The study participants had primary hand osteoarthritis, were 40 years and older, and were recruited from rheumatology clinics in the Rotterdam region from July 2010 to December 2013. They were randomly assigned to oral hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day for 24 weeks or to placebo. Paracetamol ( Tylenol ) was used as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was a decrease in hand pain in the previous 24 hours, rated on a visual analogue scale, after 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain at 6 and 12 weeks, change in total score on the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN), and score on the 10-point Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 (AIMS2-SF) at the end of the study. At baseline, median pain was similar in the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (45 vs 50 mm), as was mean AUSCAN score (5.2 vs 5.0) and mean AIMS2-SF score (3.7 vs 3.9). After 24 weeks of treatment, the difference in median pain was not significantly different between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (36 vs 48 mm). In fact, there were no significant differences in pain scores, AUSCAN scores, or AIMS-SF2 scores between the two groups at any timepoint. Table. Mean Difference in Outcome Measures from Baseline to 24 Weeks Outcome Measure Hydroxychloroquine Group (n = 98) Placebo Group (n = 98) P Value Pain, mm –1.300 0.100 .82 Total AUSCAN –0.420 –0.250 .49 Total AIMS2-SF –0.076 –0.170 .68   \"Our study was the first randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of symptomatic hand osteoarthritis,\" Dr Basoski told Medscape Medical News in an email. \"And while it was well tolerated, it was still associated with more allergic reactions and rash than placebo,\" she reported. \"So our trial does not support the prescription of hydroxychloroquine in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of hand osteoarthritis.\" Off-Label Use \"Hydroxychloroquine is sometimes used off-label to treat osteoarthritis of the hands in patients who fail standard therapies such as paracetamol, other analgesics, NSAIDs, and steroid injections,\" said Scott Zashin, MD, from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas in an email to Medscape Medical News . However, this study evaluated hydroxychloroquine in only one type of osteoarthritis that affects the hands, he cautioned. \"The authors made it clear that other types of osteoarthritis — for example, erosive osteoarthritis — may benefit from treatment with hydroxychloroquine, even though controlled studies are not available at this time to answer such a question,\" Dr Zashin explained.

				"body": "Despite sometimes emotional testimonials from boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and their families, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs advisory committee has determined that studies of the investigational drug eteplirsen don't provide persuasive evidence that the drug is effective in DMD. But the vote was close, illustrating how some panel members were torn between two different interpretations of the presented data. In the end, 3 members felt that substantial evidence was provided to support eteplirsen as effective for treating DMD, compared to 7 who didn't and 3 who abstained. Some panel members acknowledged that the public speakers — there were 52 of them during the day-long proceedings — were compelling and that there is a profound unmet need for boys with DMD. But while many agreed that the drug does produce dystrophin — the protein that's lacking in DMD — most said it's unclear what effect this actually has clinically. In the end, for most members there were too many issues surrounding an important study of the drug that was small, had ambiguous results, and used a questionable external control. DMD is a progressive, debilitating, and ultimately fatal inherited X-linked neuromuscular disease. It's caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene that disrupts the mRNA reading frame, resulting in a lack of dystrophin. Eteplirsen was developed to cause \"skipping\" of exon 51 in mRNA, which could increase production of a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein. About 13% of the approximately 9000 to 12,000 people with DMD in the United States have mutations of the dystrophin gene that are amenable to therapies that skip exon 51. Other drugs that act through a similar mechanism have so far met with mixed success. In January, the FDA declined approval of drisapersen ( Kyndrisa , Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc) for the treatment of DMD, after the FDA advisory committee recommended against it. Another drug, ataluren ( Translarna , PTC Therapeutics), has a \"conditional\" approval in the European Union, a mechanism that allows patients with serious or life-threatening disorders to receive a drug before it has gone through the full approval process. Conditional approval must be renewed yearly and can be revoked if confirmatory studies don't show a drug is safe and effective. It is not yet approved in the United States. For eteplirsen, the company, Sarepta Therapeutics, is seeking accelerated approval (AA) for the treatment administered as weekly 30 mg/kg intravenous infusions for these patients. The AA pathway allows for an acceptable degree of uncertainty about whether the therapy will actually result in the anticipated clinical benefit. In some circumstances, the FDA is amenable to trials using external controls, or historical controls, if these are adequate and well controlled. For review by the FDA, the company submitted studies of eteplirsen, including Study 201, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 12 boys with DMD who were in the ambulatory decline phase of the disease. The primary endpoint was percentage dystrophin-positive fibers. In this study, significant dystrophin production was observed at 24 weeks for the 30 mg/kg dose group but not at the earlier 12-week time point for the 50 mg/kg group. This, said the company, suggests that duration for eteplirsen therapy is more important than dose. After 24 weeks, the 4 placebo recipients rolled over to an open-label phase along with the 8 patients randomly assigned to eteplirsen for a pooled group of 12 patients (Study 202). The primary endpoint of Study 202 was change in the 6-meter walking test (6MWT) at 48 weeks. A difference between groups was not observed, mainly because of 2 boys receiving eteplirsen who lost ambulation. According to the company, these boys may have received the treatment too late in the course of their disease. An analysis excluding these patients found that the 10 treated boys performed better on the 6MWT than those receiving placebo. On the basis of these results, Study 202 was extended. The primary endpoint of percentage dystrophin-positive fibers at week 48 was achieved, said the company. External Controls The 12 boys from Study 201/202 were compared to an external control group of 13 boys with DMD mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping who were of similar age and had similar steroid use. The company reported that the eteplirsen-treated patients had a 148-meter ( P = .005) advantage at year 3 on the 6MWT compared with the external control group. An updated year 4 analysis of 6MWT showed a sustained benefit for eteplirsen vs the external control patients, with a 162-meter ( P = .0005) advantage. According to the company, \"these results are both clinically relevant and statistically persuasive.\" Sensitivity analyses — including baseline covariates of age and steroid use — also demonstrated a greater than 100-meter treatment benefit for the eteplirsen-treated group compared with the external control group. The findings were also supported by comparisons to a larger, more conservative external control group of 50 boys amenable to any exon skipping. The supportive endpoint of the 17-item North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), which assesses activities such as standing, walking, hopping, and climbing, showed that after the first year, decline in function for the eteplirsen group slowed and by the end of year 3, there was a 2.4-point greater decline for the untreated boys. This difference may represent loss or impairment of up to 2 activities of daily living. According to the company, eteplirsen \"unequivocally\" demonstrated production of de novo dystrophin. It reported an 11.6-fold increase from baseline on the Western blot test at week 180 in treated patients, representing a mean percentage of normal dystrophin protein of 0.93%. This 0.93% became a point of discussion during the day-long meeting. For some boys with DMD, this amount is meaningful and not to be dismissed. As one public speaker said, very low levels of dystrophin can have significant effects on muscle function. Along with Western blot, other common methods of showing production of \"skipped\" mRNA and restored dystrophin protein are reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (used to provide evidence that the desired mRNA is produced) and immunofluorescence (used to localize protein and is semi-quantitative for total immune-reactive signal). But according to some speakers, there are issues with these measurements. The company reported no significant safety risks, with most adverse events being mild and consistent with the population. There was a low rate of discontinuations and serious adverse events. This was echoed consistently by patients and families — some of whom had come from as far away as the United Kingdom — during the public hearing portion of the meeting. Many were from groups called Make Duchenne History and Duchenne Connect. These passionate speakers repeatedly relayed how the drug has improved their — or their son's — quality of life with absolutely no adverse effects. \"This drug is not a false promise,\" said one mother. \"My son is not an outlier,\" said another. It was such testimonials that clearly touched the panel. \"I have been extraordinarily influenced and impressed by the people who spoke about this drug and their observations,\" said Mark W. Green, MD, professor, neurology, anesthesia and rehabilitative medicine, and director, headache and pain medicine, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, New York. FDA Concerns But Ronald Farkas, MD, PhD, clinical team leader, Division of Neurology Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA, raised many issues regarding the analyses presented by the company. Although the FDA felt the Western blot was the most accurate method to determine relative levels of total dystrophin protein, it raised some technical issues with some of the biopsies. For example, control samples were from different muscle groups, healthy controls weren't sex matched (a female and two healthy males were combined for a mean value), and dystrophin varied from 51% to 95% in healthy controls. Dr Farkas also pointed out that instead of the expected dystrophin levels of 25% to 50%, which were indicated by the company early in the clinical development program, a \"very low level\" of 0.93% was reported from the fourth biopsy. By the most reliable Western blot methods, dystrophin less than about 3% of normal muscle appears to be associated with the typical DMD phenotype, he said. The FDA also raised questions about the appropriateness of the external control group. Dr Farkas pointed out that 2 of the 13 external controls were able to perform the 10-meter walk/run test reasonably well (10 and 12 seconds) yet were deemed unable to attempt the 6MWT, that eteplirsen recipients had two opportunities to perform the 6MWT, and that 2 external control patients with missing data were analyzed as \"0\" for the NSAA. Glen Nuckolls, PhD, program director and executive secretary, Interagency Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee, National Institutes of Health, was among the panel members swayed by this information. \"It caused me to question the objectivity and comparability of the 6MWT.\" Further, Dr Farkas noted, eteplirsen recipients were treated with steroids for about a year longer than the controls. Such seemingly small differences may have large effects in age of loss of ambulation, he said. There is some suggestion that physical function may be affected simply by being enrolled in an efficacy study. Also, motivation may have been different in the two groups, as perhaps were the judgments and attitudes of caregivers, investigators, and patients themselves. There was also some question about why the study outcomes assessed only lower-limb function. Several panel members noted that the litany of benefits the public speakers referred to were not captured by the 6MWT or the secondary endpoint of NSAA. Poorly Matched As for the outcome of percentage positive fibers, \"because of poorly matched controls, the proportion of the dystrophin that was produced by eteplirsen, as opposed to the dystrophin that can be present at baseline, appears to be uncertain,\" said Dr Farkas. \"Ratios of treated to control values presented by the applicant appear to be 'apples to oranges' comparisons because of poorly matched controls and lack reliability because of small and questionably calculated denominators.\" Another issue for the FDA, and some panel members, was the lack of a traditionally controlled trial. The FDA had consistently strongly encouraged the company, beginning back in 2011, to perform an adequately powered randomized, double-blind, controlled trial and expressed strong doubts along the way about the interpretability of comparison to external controls. The sponsor indicated that there initially was not enough study drug available to carry out this type of trial. Yet another concern for the FDA was lack of apparent correlation between dystrophin levels and change in 6MWT. Dr Farkas noted that for the 4 patients with the most preserved 6MWT, 2 had among the lowest and 2 had among the highest levels. All treated patients have declined substantially on NSAA, including the several older patients (age about 14) and those with more preserved 6MWT, he said. \"There appears to be little reason to believe a loss of ambulation for these patients will exceed the typical range in untreated patients with DMD.\" It doesn't seem possible to conclude that differences in physical performance between eteplirsen-treated patients and external controls resulted from an effect of the drug \"instead of from other differences and influences, both known and unknown, between the groups, both at baseline and during conduct of the study,\" Dr Farkas concluded. Following discussions, the committee voted 5 to 8 that the applicant provided substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies that eteplirsen induces production of dystrophin to a level that is reasonably likely to have a clinical benefit. \"We don't have a clue about how much dystrophin is clinically significant, and it's also hard to know if what is produced is as clinically active as natively produced normal dystrophin,\" commented committee chair, G. Caleb Alexander, MD, associate professor, epidemiology and medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland. Dr Alexander said he was \"surprised\" that experts are not further along \"in figuring out what amount of dystrophin would constitute a clinically meaningful response.\" Although he said he was \"willing to accept\" that eteplirsen did lead to some dystrophin production, Chiadi Onyike, MD, associate professor, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Division of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neuropsychiatry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, said it's still \"very small and within the range of what people with the disease have.\" 'In my mind it's very important to have some sort of coupling between the dystrophin production and a clinical effect; we don't have that,\" he said. However, Dr Onyike pointed out that it is possible for a medication to have an effect without knowing why. He used acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) as an example. \"I'm not entirely sure you should lock the clinical effect to the dystrophin production.\" On the other hand, many committee members strongly agreed that there's plenty of evidence to the support mechanism of action of the drug. Valid Comparison? The committee voted 5 to 7 (1 abstention) that decisions to administer the 6MWT were sufficiently objective and free of bias and subjective decision making by patients, caregivers, and/or health care professionals to allow for a valid comparison between patients and an external control group. Dr Onyike noted the discrepancy between the outcomes as depicted by the FDA analysis, which \"don't line up as a positive effect,\" and the testimony of patients and family members, who, one after the other, talked about how the drug allows them to do things like open cans and grip bottles. \"None of that is captured by the NSAA or the 6MWT or the 10-meter walk test, so you have an unfortunate discrepancy between what the families are describing as tangible benefits and what is actually measured.\" Dr Onyike, who works in the field of dementia, also pointed out that caregiver outcomes are routinely included in clinical trials of dementia. Richard Kryscio, PhD, professor, statistics and chair, biostatistics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, noted that for some diseases — for example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which has similar loss of ambulation — there are well-designed trials that use functional rating scales. In a vote on the impact of the NSAA on the persuasiveness of the study findings, 2 members thought it strengthened the impact while 5 thought it weakened it and 6 felt it had no effect. Most (10) members felt that the other tests of physical performance, such as the rise time, had no effect on the persuasiveness of the studies presented. As Richard Hoffman, PharmD, a drug information consultant and medical writer in Hernando, Florida, commented, \"there is a difference of opinion between the FDA and the sponsor and neither proved the case one way or the other.\" Another panel member said that in the absence of a concurrent control group, it's difficult to interpret any of these secondary outcome measures. In the final vote, 3 members felt that substantial evidence was provided to support eteplirsen as effective for treating DMD compared with 7 who didn't and 3 who abstained. On this vote, Dr Hoffman abstained, noting, \"I was torn between my mind and my heart and I don't want to make a type 1 error and I don't want to make type 2 error.\" Paul Romitti, PhD, professor, Department of Epidemiology and Interdisciplinary Program in Toxicology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, also abstained, saying he was \"conflicted\" because while he \"can't say\" that the study was adequate and well controlled, he \"was moved by the public testimony.\" Many of the others raised various concerns regarding the ability to draw valid conclusions from a small study with an externally controlled comparison. \"The ways that the controls were selected and analyzed didn't meet the threshold that I would consider to be adequate and well controlled,\" said Dr Alexander. On the other side, though, were panelists such as Reghan Foley, MD, a pediatric neuromuscular specialist, at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health. \"For me, there is substantial evidence that there is clearly amelioration of the clinical phenotype of DMD. But I believe more data is needed and I also believe that looking at other biomarkers would be very helpful as well.\" For more Medscape Neurology news, join us on Facebook and Twitter . ",

				"body": "Medicine is often presented as a science, deploying precise clinical data and purely rational dispassion. Some doctors, however, admit to relying on a gut feeling, an intuition based not on facts or clearly defined reasons but on a less tangible sense of unease with the condition of a patient. Recently on Medscape Connect, an all-physician discussion group, doctors spoke of this ineffable diagnostic tool—whether they believed in it and whether they used it. A general practitioner kicked off the conversation: Although clearly not evidence based, I have heard stories of patients whose lives were saved because their doctors trusted their instincts. Has this happened to you? If so, what was the clinical situation? Has it happened more than once? A neurologist piped up with a sprightly comparison: Making a diagnosis is analogous to [putting together] a jigsaw puzzle. Some jigsaw puzzles are easy, perhaps 10 large pieces that are simple and easy to fit together. Others are the more complicated 5000-piece puzzles. That gut feeling occurs when one or more pieces of the puzzle, whether 10 pieces or 5000 pieces, doesn't fit with the other pieces, no matter how you orient them. At least for me, that is one of the things that triggers the gut feeling. A primary care physician shared personal experience: I have long ago learned to trust my gut feelings. [I once] saw a toddler...[who had experienced] fever for a couple of days. When I walked in, he was sleeping (but it was evening and past his bedtime) and the exam didn't show anything specific. His temperature was 101. [I] gave him Tylenol, and about 45 minutes later he was a bit more awake and drinking from his cup. I sent him home, all the while my gut telling me to get some kind of lab on him. I found out later that he wound up in the hospital the next day with meningitis. An internist turned the question on its head, implying that much of the data-driven evidence in modern medicine is unnecessary: \"Trusting your gut increasingly means ignoring misleading imaging reports and ignoring lab results on tests that should not have been ordered in the first place.\" But a dermatologist disagreed and shot back, \"[The] reality is that sometimes you still have to be objective and order all the painful and unnecessary tests, as your gut feeling can be wrong, especially in patients with obvious mental illness and anxiety.\" Some physicians sought to reclassify gut feelings as a synthesis of evidence. One primary care physician recalled a trusted teacher who supported following an intuitive impulse, defining it as: \"All we knew of our patients' medical history, our past experiences with them, plus the myriad of subconscious data we input from the patient as they walk into the exam room: how they dress, sit, smell, greet and engage us.\" An internist argued in a similar but not identical vein. \"The fact is that a gut feeling [is] a clinical eye.\" And a neurologist added, \"Intuition is not clairvoyance but a cognitive process that is dependent upon preprogrammed pattern recognition. It is analogous to the programmed motor sequences that allow us to walk or catch a moving object such as a baseball coming towards us.\" \"Can we just call it experience or clinical acumen?\" asked a gastroenterologist, more uncomfortable with the phrase \"gut feeling\" than with its use as a diagnostic tool. A primary care physician also shied away from using the term, especially around patients. \"I do try to communicate a bit more professionally [by saying] 'my impression is' as opposed to 'my gut feeling is.'\" But there were also some physicians who were highly distrustful of vague abdominal rumblings. A gastroenterologist was among them: I do not trust my gut feelings, nor any other doctors' gut feelings. It means one does not believe the signs, symptoms, and studies...If they act on these gut feelings, some will be saved (much talked about) and some will be harmed (no one really talks about these). Others, like one dermatologist, saw the use of this kind of intuition as beneficial, but only in moderation: In many ways a gut feeling is the equivalent of prejudice...As long as you understand, [a gut feeling] can both help you and hurt you...But if you trust it 100% of the time, you can hurt your patients. An internist, concerned with malpractice and online ratings, quipped, \"Forget my gut; I should pay attention to my lawyer and my publicist.\" And, of course, there were a fair number of jokes concerning the digestive tract, best represented by an experienced internist: I have to say I get nagging feelings quite often, and so I hardly ever trust my gut unless I've taken some FiberCon...What's more, when you guys get to be my age, you'll likely feel the very same way.

				"body": "(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's consumer healthcare unit said on Friday it is recalling about 200,000 bottles of concentrated Motrin drops for infants due to potential contamination with plastic particles. The company is asking U.S. retailers to remove the affected half-ounce bottles of original berry flavored drops from store shelves. It said consumers should dispose of any recalled product they may have and suggested they contact the company about refunds. Three lots are being recalled because plastic particles, about the size of a poppy seed, were identified during the manufacturing of a fourth, undistributed, lot of the drops. J&J said it determined that the particles originated in a shipment from a third party supplier of ibuprofen, the active ingredient in the Motrin drops. The company said in a statement that it has worked with that supplier to ensure that corrective measures are in place, and said use of the drops is unlikely to cause adverse medical reactions. In 2010, J&J took more than 40 nonprescription products off store shelves, including Children's Tylenol, after investigators identified problems at its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania manufacturing plant, in what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has characterized as the largest recall of children's medicine in the agency's history. The company agreed in July to pay $22.9 million to end a lawsuit from investors who claimed it concealed quality-control failures. ",

				"body": "December 29, 2009 — A nauseating \"moldy\" odor has sickened some people using Tylenol Arthritis Pain Caplet 100-count bottles with red EZ-Open caps. Tylenol maker McNeil PPC Inc. has recalled all of this product, which is easily recognized by its distinctive red cap. The new recall expands a five-lot recall of the product announced last November. McNeill says consumers reported the product had \"an unusual moldy, musty, or mildew-like odor\" linked to symptoms of nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.\" So far, all of these health events \"were temporary and non-serious,\" McNeill says in a news release. The source of the odor appears to come from the breakdown product of a chemical used to treat the wooden pallets on which the product's packaging materials were transported and stored. The chemical linked to the odor, 2,4,6-tribromoanisole, is produced when fungi break down a commonly used fungicide called 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The full health effects of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are not known. Consumers who purchased the products should immediately stop using them and contact McNeil for a refund or replacement. McNeil can be reached on its web site or by telephone at 888-222-6036 Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Any adverse reactions linked to the product should be reported to the FDA MedWatch program at 800-FDA-0178 or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch . All of the recalled products carry the UPC #0045-0838-21 and the Code #8382100.

				"body": "Is the Need for Foreign Graduates Changing? Is the Need for Foreign Graduates Changing? International medical graduates (IMGs)—physicians with degrees from foreign medical schools—may be facing some fundamental challenges in their role in the US healthcare system. For more than half a century, there has been a mutually beneficial relationship between IMGs and the residency training system. Programs have more positions than US graduates, so IMGs are needed to fill in the gap. For their part, IMGs are attracted to a US healthcare system that may often be more advanced than their own. Though many IMGs go back home after training, many others apply for residency positions to get into the US system. IMGs have been able to count on a relatively abundant number of residency positions that can't be filled by US graduates. In academic year 2014-2015, for example, there were 21.7% more slots than US seniors, according to a November 2015 report [1] published by some top physician-supply experts in the New England Journal of Medicine . In the future, however, it may be harder for IMGs to get those positions, owing to a huge increase in the number of US medical school graduates, the authors wrote. Since 2002, 16 new allopathic and 15 new osteopathic medical schools have opened in the United States, and many existing schools have expanded class sizes. By the time all of the new US students get through the pipeline, medical school enrollment in the states will have risen by almost 50%, they wrote. The problem for IMGs is that it's hard to grow the number of residency positions to meet this surge, so that they can have the same number of slots as before. Medicare, the chief funder of residency positions, hasn't increased the number of funded positions since 1997. However, the situation for IMGs isn't as dire as many people think, the authors reported. Although Medicare lags, other funding sources are stepping up to the plate. For example, a bill passed by Congress in 2014 to reform the Veterans Health Administration will provide 1500 more training slots. As a result, the authors forecasted that the proportion of slots available to non-US graduates would indeed shrink, but is far from disappearing—dropping from 21.7% of positions in 2014-2015 to 13.5% by 2023-2024. So far, however, the big squeeze on IMGs has yet to materialize. The National Resident Matching Program reported [2] that the 2015 Match offered a record number of positions and was the best ever for IMGs, and the match rate for US-citizen IMGs was the highest since 2005. But as US schools continue to increase their graduating classes, IMGs are expected to feel the pinch. Furthermore, IMGs from many foreign schools could become completely locked out of the US system in the next decade. The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) has announced [3] that in 2023, it will require all applicants to have graduated from schools that have been accredited by standards that are equivalent to those used for US schools. To achieve this standard, the ECFMG will be evaluating accreditors for hundreds of schools around the world. Having to Exceed US Standards Having to Exceed US Standards Even today, when there's a relative abundance of residency slots for them, IMGs still have to clear a set of hurdles to break into the US system, and only a minority of applicants will succeed. First, they have to take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), testing them for a somewhat different style of medicine than they were used to back home. What's more, many IMGs who are citizens of other countries (foreign IMGs [FIMGs]) have to take the test in an unfamiliar language. 250 188 1 All IMGs who pass the USMLE have to be accepted to the ECFMG, which verifies their medical education and issues certificates based on USMLE performance. Only about one half of ECFMG applicants get certified. After ECFMG certification, IMGs have to be accepted into a US residency program. Again, only about one half get a residency slot, according to the National Resident Matching Program, which oversees placement of applicants into residency programs. FIMGs have the further burden of being unknown entities when they apply for residency programs. In many cases, they haven't had a US clerkship and may not know a US physician willing to write them a recommendation letter, both of which are important criteria for the program directors choosing positions. Because they're almost completely unknown, IMGs have to stand out in some way—which usually means being \"academic rock stars,\" according to Geoffrey A. Talmon, MD, director of the pathology program at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. For these reasons, FIMG applicants need to have higher scores on the USMLE than US graduates. A 2009 study [4] found that FIMGs have higher scores than USIMGs on Step 1 and Step 2 (Clinical Knowledge)—though not on Step 2 (Clinical Skills), which includes tests of spoken English and communication skills. FIMGs may even outperform US graduates when they enter medical practice. A 2010 peer-reviewed study [5] found that among patients with congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, those treated by FIMGs had lower mortality rates than those treated by graduates of US medical schools. The study was led by John J. Norcini, PhD, president and CEO of the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research, which consists of organizations that certify the competency of US doctors. These groups include the Federation of State Medical Boards, the National Board of Medical Examiners, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and the American Board of Medical Specialties. \"We have been blessed with the cream of the crop of the doctors from other countries,\" says Dr Norcini, who previously oversaw clinical evaluation at the American Board of Internal Medicine. Breaking Into the US System Has Always Been Hard Breaking Into the US System Has Always Been Hard IMGs often have to take extra steps to ensure entry into the US system. Busharat Ahmad, MD, a retired ophthalmologist who helped found the IMG Section of the American Medical Association (AMA) in the 1990s, recalls that he didn't get into the US system in one easy step. Dr Ahmad was part of the first great wave of IMGs into the US in the 1950s. He came here hoping to train in ophthalmology after graduating from the University of Karachi in Pakistan in 1956. \"I got a couple of responses, but no dice,\" he recalls. He was told it was impossible for an IMG to get into a US ophthalmology program. However, he tried a program in London and was accepted there. On the strength of the British diploma, he was able to get into an ophthalmology program in St Louis and, finally, into one at Harvard. Getting into the US system is still a difficult task for IMGs today. Because their educational backgrounds are often viewed here as being unclear, and because they often lack a favorable letter of recommendation from a US physician, \"It's harder to get a sense of their medical reasoning abilities and procedural skill sets from the standard outside documentation,\" says Dr Talmon, the pathology program director. \"So when we look at foreign-national IMGs,\" he continues, \"we tend to look at only the very best.\" These applicants have very high USMLE scores and high grades, or have done research work at a world-class institution. Many other program directors feel this way, too. A 2010 study [6] found that when psychiatry and family practice programs were given identical applications, they were 80% more likely to respond to US seniors than to IMGs. The higher bar for FIMGs means they have to work harder and do more. Writing in 2011, Kenneth Christopher, MD, a nephrologist who is assistant director of the Preliminary Residency Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, estimated that whereas most US seniors take about 4 weeks to study for Step 1 of the USMLE, some IMGs study for 2 focused years. [7] Carl Shusterman, an immigration-law attorney in Los Angeles, reports that many FIMGs arrive in the US on student visas 2 years before applying for programs, so that they can take prep courses for the USMLE at such companies as Kaplan. They also try to get paid observerships and externships at hospitals, so that they can gain some clinical experience and make contacts with physicians. In addition, they may take research positions in the United States as another way to stand out when they contact program directors. But many don't make it. \"I spent close to US $18,000 [and] wasted 2 years,\" a Pakistani IMG who failed to get a match wrote [8] on a website for IMGs in 2013. \"My fiancée of 5 years almost left me and it was very hard convincing her to stay.\" Shut Out of the System for Good Shut Out of the System for Good Whereas many IMGs go back home after they fail to get a residency position, many others stay in America. In many cases, their spouses are US citizens or hold green cards, or they've obtained refugee status, according to José Ramón Fernández-Peña, MD, associate professor of health education at San Francisco State University. Dr Fernández-Peña, an IMG from Mexico who made it into the US system, is the founder of the Welcome Back Initiative, a nonprofit organization that helps doctors and other healthcare professionals educated abroad find work here. Despite their healthcare training in their native countries, most of these people wind up doing menial work when they arrive in the United States, such as driving taxis or working as janitors, Dr Fernández-Peña says. \"Highly trained people are sitting around unable to use their expertise. It's a great waste of brainpower.\" Welcome Back helps many participants find healthcare work, but it's much harder to help foreign doctors get into their profession. Of more than 4600 foreign-trained physicians who have participated in Welcome Back, only 130 have subsequently won US residency slots, Dr Fernández-Peña reports. That translates to a success rate of under 3%. These IMGs get shut out of the system quickly, often because they didn't understand how it works, Dr Fernández-Peña says. For example, many decided to take the USMLE without adequate study. If they fail, they can try again, but the initial score goes onto their permanent record. Even if they score well later, their chances of getting into a residency are almost zero. Dr Fernández-Peña helped found a free program for Spanish-speaking IMGs at the University of California, Los Angeles. Entrants get test-preparation courses and clinical observerships to help them get into the US system, and in return, they agree to spend 2-3 years in family medicine programs that treat underserved populations. But owing to the cost of the program, just a few slots are available, which hardly puts a dent in the need for Hispanic doctors in California. Dr Fernández-Peña says that although 35% of Californians are Latino, only 5% of California doctors share their ethnicity. Doctors from the Middle East are another group of IMGs who fall into limbo here, according to Wael Al-Delaimy, MD, an Iraqi-born IMG who works in the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health at the University of California, San Diego. Many of these IMGs \"came here in mid-career as refugees with a green card,\" he says. \"They had no job and no income, and that's devastating on multiple fronts. Imagine, you were the lead surgeon at home and now you have become an assistant to an assistant.\" He tries to find contacts for these doctors with US training programs—he helped host a jobs forum for about 50 FIMGs last year—but he says it remains an uphill struggle for these doctors. Gaining Entry Via Caribbean Schools Gaining Entry Via Caribbean Schools An increasing number of IMGs entering the US system are US citizens, mostly from medical schools in the Caribbean. The oldest Caribbean schools—St George's University School of Medicine and Ross University—were founded in the late 1970s, when it was becoming more difficult to get into US medical schools. Students with grade point averages and scores on the Medical College Admission Test that would have gotten them into US schools only a few years earlier found themselves shut out. Today, the competition for enrollment in US medical schools may be even more intense. The AAMC reported [9] in 2013 that a record number of people applied to US medical schools, yet despite an increase in the number of positions available, only 41% of applicants were accepted. About 28,000 students who had planned a medical career were turned away from US schools. Some of these students apply to Caribbean schools, which have been growing rapidly. The ECFMG's 2014 Annual Report [4] shows that the number of ECFMG applicants from Caribbean schools doubled from 2000 to 2013, and USIMGs now account for almost one third of ECFMG certificates. Fully 31 medical schools in the Caribbean cater to US students, and the flow of graduates back to the United States has been growing, according to the AAMC report. The quality of Caribbean schools varies. A peer-reviewed study [10] of Caribbean schools led by Dr Norcini found that the rate of a school's graduates getting ECFMG certificates ranged from 28% to 86%. Many of the established Caribbean schools, such as Ross and St George's, were at the top end. Working Hard to Erase a Stigma Caribbean schools have been champing at the bit to prove their quality. Accreditors of Caribbean schools have been at the forefront of qualifying for the ECFMG's new accreditation standards. In 2015, with the deadline for approval still 8 years away, the ECFMG announced [11] that the accrediting body for several Caribbean schools was one of only three accreditors to be approved so far. USIMGs have a leg up on graduates from other foreign schools because their schools closely imitate US schools. The USIMGs' schools have basically the same curricula, employ US-trained faculty, and even send their students to clinical clerkships in the states. They tend to go to clerkships in New York State, where the state Department of Health takes on the unusual role of monitoring the quality of these clerkships. In US clerkships, students can audition for US-based physicians, who may write letters of recommendation for them for training programs. FIMGs, in contrast, rarely are able to enter US clerkships and are always struggling to find US doctors who could recommend them. US program directors who screen applicants for the crucial step of residency training like being able to assess an education similar to that of US graduates, says Dr Talmon. \"I don't treat USIMGs any differently than medical students from US schools,\" he says. \"When they come into the program, I can't tell the difference from the US graduates.\" Program directors' greater familiarity with USIMGs' experiences may explain why USIMGs have somewhat better odds of being matched to a residency program than do FIMGs: 53.1% for USIMGs in 2015 compared with 49.4% of FIMGs, the ECFMG reports. [12] Whereas some program directors require a minimum score on the USMLE—typically around 230 or 240 out of a perfect score of 300—Dr Talmon isn't so hung up on scores. \"The USMLE was initially designed as kind of a driver's license test, in which passing or failing was the important thing,\" he says. \"If you get just a few answers wrong, it can have a huge impact on your score.\" According to recent statistics, USIMGs fit very well into US workforce needs. When they go into practice, they fill in the gaps in primary care even better than FIMGs or DOs. A 2013 report [13] found that 56.7% of Caribbean-educated USIMGs chose a primary care specialty, compared with 54.0% of osteopathic graduates, 42.3% of non-Caribbean IMGs, and 32.9% of graduates from US allopathic schools. Having a Limited Set of Choices Having a Limited Set of Choices When IMGs actually get into residency, they find that their career choices are decidedly more limited than for US graduates. According to the physician-supply experts writing [1] in the New England Journal of Medicine , the way the US system works is that IMGs get very little specialty choice so that US seniors can have much more specialty choice. US seniors enjoy a \"selection subsidy,\" the authors wrote. IMGs take the less competitive positions in primary care, and as a result, US seniors have improved chances of getting highly competitive positions in such areas as surgery. The US students wouldn't have such a wide choice if there were just enough positions for them alone. In other words, in a zero-sum system, they would have to take a certain percentage of primary care slots or not get anything at all. There has been a wide gap between IMGs' specialties and those of US seniors. In the 2015 Match, 39% of US seniors chose primary care, and those who chose internal medicine often plan to subspecialize. Meanwhile, fully 67% of IMGs filled primary care spots. For many of them, it was the only way to get into the US system. In some cases, the specialties they had practiced in their home countries were different from the ones they were able to get into here. Most IMGs seem to make the best of this lack of specialty choice and enjoy a career in their assigned specialty, but some do not. A study [14] of family physicians found that being an IMG was a key predictor of dissatisfaction with the specialty. When many IMGs in internal medicine try to subspecialize, the choices again are limited. Fellowships in some subspecialties are less IMG-friendly than others. An analysis [15] of 2012 Match data found that although infectious diseases was the easiest subspecialty for all applicants to get into, on the basis of the ratio of applications to acceptances, it was the third hardest for IMGs. And although allergy was the sixth hardest for all applicants to get into, it was the hardest of all for IMGs. Nephrology, on the other hand, was the second easiest for everyone and the easiest of all for IMGs. Nevertheless, nephrology wasn't the first choice for many of the IMGs going into it. In a separate 2012 study, [16] 23% of IMG nephrologists didn't choose the specialty, compared with 11% of US graduates Even after training, many FIMGs again put aside what they want to do and agree to work in remote areas of the United States. Left to their own devices, FIMGs tend to gravitate to large urban areas, where they can congregate with other people from their country, but they agree to serve in remote areas because that's the only way they can stay in America. The J-1 visas that are issued to FIMGs during training require them to go back to their home countries for 2 years after their training is completed. Apparently most of them do go back home—after all, many of them came here just for the training. But J-1 holders can get the requirement waived if they agree to work in an underserved area in the United States for a few years in several different programs. There are a limited number of such positions, and the competition for them is often very intense. As one might expect, working in small-town America can be quite lonely for a newly arrived foreigner. In his book My Own Country , Abraham Verghese, MD, recounts serving as a resident in Johnson City, Tennessee, where he was virtually the only person from India. He recalled going to the local bar to drink with one of his few friends, the mechanic who worked on his car. Afterward, Dr Verghese entered an infectious diseases fellowship in Boston. But interestingly, when he finally had a choice of where to practice, he decided to return to Johnson City. He turned out to be invaluable to the community, fighting the AIDS epidemic when it had just arrived in the area. Meeting Cultural Challenges Meeting Cultural Challenges Graduates from India are still the largest IMG group in the United States, representing 20.7% of the total, according to the AMA's IMG Section. [17] However, there has been a decline in the number of new candidates from India and a rise in the number of USIMGs, according to a recent speech [18] by the ECFMG's president. Even so, FIMGs still make up the lion's share of the American IMG population. In addition to India, the top countries of origin for FIMGs are Pakistan, China, the Philippines, Iran, and Israel, according to the AMA's IMG Section. When Alok A. Khorana, MD, an Indian IMG, arrived at a US residency program in 1996, it was a massive culture shock. \"I had never used a pager or answered a page, never looked up labs on a computer screen, never dictated a note, never been exposed to American patients' expectations of privacy and medical information, never dealt with discharge planning or nursing home placement or insurance issues,\" he recalled in an article [19] in Health Affairs . He had already been responsible for treating patients at his medical school in India, so his clinical experience was vastly greater than that of his US peers, but when he treated his first patient, he was stumped. She needed something for her pain, and the nurse on duty suggested Tylenol, but Dr Khorana had never heard of Tylenol. He realized then that he had many more things to learn. He easily made it through residency, but he faults his program (and most others) for failing to provide an orientation course for IMGs. Most FIMGs also have to struggle with language. Since all of them had to pass the Spoken English Proficiency component of the USMLE, they can speak and understand English very well, but \"the ability to communicate goes beyond the ability to speak and write English,\" according to an opinion piece [20] published by the American College of Physicians. \"Accents, slang terminology, street language, and idioms all influence the communication between physician and patients as well as hospital staff,\" wrote Barbara L. Schuster, MD, a former American College of Physicians regent. \"It's easier for people like me, because I've spoken English all my life, even in medical school,\" Dr Ahmad says, \"but I know I still have an accent.\" (His English is usually quite clear, but when he said he had studied at Harvard, it sounded like he said \"Howard.\") \"Also, there is a different kind of English spoken here, so you have to learn the lingo,\" he says. FIMGs can take courses to improve their language skills. According to the \"medical accent reduction\" page [21] on the website of G.E.T. English Training in Dallas, \"there is a big difference between a language barrier and an accent barrier. If you are frequently asked to repeat yourself, you are a candidate for accent reduction.\" Dr Ahmad, a dignified man of patrician bearing, became a kind of George Washington figure for IMGs in the AMA. In the late 1980s, he served on an AMA committee that planned an IMG advisory committee and became its chair when it was launched in 1989. And when it became a full-fledged AMA section in 1997, he became the section's first chair. For 2 or 3 years after the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001, Dr Ahmad reports, it was hard for IMGs from such countries as Pakistan to get visa clearances from the US Department of State. The Struggle to Get Promoted The Struggle to Get Promoted IMGs have a conflicting sense of self-worth in America, says Peggy G. Chen, MD, a researcher at the RAND Corporation who has studied the IMG experience extensively. \"As a doctor, you're in a high-prestige position, but as an IMG, you may be viewed as an outsider by some of your patients and some of your colleagues,\" says Dr Chen, whose own parents were highly educated immigrants. According to a 2012 study [22] that Dr Chen led, IMGs report lower satisfaction with their careers. Whereas 82.3% of US graduates reported career satisfaction, 75.7% of IMGs did so. The study was unable to identify why this is, but some light was shed on this in an earlier anecdotal study [23] led by Dr Chen, in which several IMGs were interviewed. In that study, a family physician from Southeast Asia working at a large organization said that few IMGs reach the top, and their work is \"not validated\" by the organization. Someone who has had these kinds of experiences is Bhushan Pandya, MD, chairman-elect of the AMA's IMG Section and a gastroenterologist in Danville, Virginia. When he arrived in Danville in 1985, he was one of the first IMGs in the area, and his application for privileges at the local hospital was \"delayed and delayed,\" he recalls. Only with the help of a lawyer was he finally able to get on staff. He then joined the same hospital credentials committee that had balked at granting him privileges and eventually became its chair. As the new evaluator of applications for privileges, \"I made sure that everyone was treated equally,\" he says. Dr Pandya's easygoing manner and willingness to promote change from the inside no doubt helped make him popular with colleagues. He became the first IMG president of the medical staff, and currently he's president-elect of the Medical Society of Virginia. Again, he's the first IMG to hold the position. \"It's to the credit of the establishment that they elected me,\" he says. Like Dr Ahmad, Dr Pandya is a steadfast advocate of assimilation. When he arrived in Danville, he was told, \"Everyone here has roots in Danville,\" he recalls. \"I may not have roots here,\" he replied, \"but my grandchildren will.\" Dr Pandya believes there's less discrimination against IMGs within medicine than when Dr Ahmad formed the IMG Section two decades ago. Last year, when leaders of the section met with the AMA president, \"nobody was talking about discrimination,\" he says. The subjects were the usual ones for other physicians: electronic medical records, the move to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases, and the new payment methodologies. \"Many of us have been able to establish ourselves in mainstream medicine,\" Dr Pandya says. \"After all, we represent 25% of the physician workforce.\" ",

				"body": "Routine questions are part of every medical visit, but are you asking patients aged 65 years and older about their fall risk? One out of three people in this age group falls each year, but fewer than half of those who fall talk to their healthcare provider about it. By asking three simple questions and taking action—when needed—you can reduce the risk of falling. Some patients think that falls just happen when you get older or are the result of bad luck, but falls are not an inevitable part of aging. There are specific things that you can do to reduce your patients' chances of falling. Hello. I'm Grant Baldwin, director of the Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention at CDC's Injury Center . When you see patients aged 65 years and older, make these three questions a routine part of your exam: Have you fallen in the past year? Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? Do you worry about falling? Patients who answer \"yes\" to any of these key screening questions are considered at increased risk of falling, and further assessment is recommended. To help, CDC created a simple tool kit called STEADI . This stands for Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths and Injuries. [1] The STEADI tool kit includes a wealth of information that can be easily downloaded and printed for display in your office or clinic. Materials include: Assessment tools; Case studies; Videos; and Educational handouts for your patients. STEADI is based on an algorithm adapted from the American and British Geriatric Societies' clinical practice guidelines. Using STEADI, you will be able to: Identify patients at low, moderate, and high risk for a fall; Identify modifiable risk factors; and Offer effective interventions. Two validated fall prevention interventions from the STEADI algorithm that can be easily integrated into routine office visits are vitamin D supplementation [3,4] and medication management. [5] Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of falling in older adults who are vitamin D deficient and is a simple thing that your patients can add to their daily routines. Medication management works by reducing interactions and side effects that may lead to falls. Effectively managing medications includes: Eliminating medications if there is no active indication; Reducing doses of necessary medications to the lowest effective dose; and Avoiding prescribing medications for an older person in whom the risk from side effects outweighs the benefits of the drug. Many medications have been linked to falls. [6] However, three types of medications that you should immediately consider reducing or eliminating among your older adult patients include: Psychoactive medications (especially benzodiazepines); Medications with anticholinergic side effects; and Sedatives that can be purchased over-the-counter, such as Tylenol® PM and Benadryl®. In our rapidly aging population, older adult fall prevention demands immediate attention. The good news is that you can make a big difference in your patients’ lives. You can help them stay healthy and independent longer by reducing their chances of falling. We hope that the information provided here will help you make fall prevention a routine part of your clinical practice.

Baldwin, PhD, MPH, is the director of the Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention (DUIP) at the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He has served in this capacity since September 2008. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for persons 1 to 44 years of age. DUIP is dedicated to reducing the number and severity of unintentional injuries through science-based programs and applied research. CDC is focused on preventing injuries and fatalities from motor vehicle-related crashes, older adult falls, prescription drug overdoses, and traumatic brain injuries. Dr Baldwin joined the CDC Injury Center in November 2006 as acting deputy director. In this role, Dr Baldwin assisted the NCIPC director in providing overall leadership and direction for the Center. He began his career at CDC in September 1996. Dr Baldwin received his PhD in Health Behavior and Health Education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in 2003. He also received an MPH in Behavioral Sciences and Health Education from the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in 1996. He is an adjunct associate professor at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health and teaches two courses, Social Behavior and Public Health and Community Needs Assessment. ",

Highlights of this year's conference include: Driving under the influence of opiates — a neglected concern? Vicodin not superior to Tylenol 3 for acute traumatic pain Radiofrequency intradiscal biacuplasty relieves discogenic low back pain Two injection approaches on par for radiating low back pain Interdisciplinary approach to fibromyalgia works Rise in benzodiazepine/opioid prescribing in primary care Ability to Drive a Concern in Opiate Prescribing With the current focus in opiate prescribing on balancing pain management while preventing addiction or abuse, attention has faltered in another critical area — patients driving under the influence of medications, said Gerald Aronoff, MD, in his keynote address. \"The biggest deficiency I see as I review records involves this issue of not monitoring safety in terms of patients driving or returning to work,\" said Dr. Aronoff, who is medical director of Carolina Pain Associates in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a past president of the AAPM. \"Driving is a complex task; when we write patients prescriptions for these drugs, we need to document in our charts the assessment of risks before we send them out on the highway.\" Vicodin Not Superior to Tylenol 3 for Acute Pain Hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Vicodin, AbbVie) failed to provide better pain relief than codeine/acetaminophen (Tylenol 3, McNeil) in a double-blind study of patients with acute traumatic pain. Emergency physicians \"have the impression that Tylenol with codeine is a far inferior pain medication to Vicodin. Impressions are not evidence-based, however, and our study questions that long-standing belief,\" said lead author Andrew Chang, MD, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York. Adverse effects — mainly drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea — were not different between groups. He advised clinicians to consider prescribing Tylenol with codeine instead of Vicodin when discharging nonelderly patients with acute extremity pain from the emergency department, except in patient subgroups known to not normally metabolize codeine. Image from Thinkstock Sustained Pain Relief With Radiofrequency Intradiscal Biacuplasty Radiofrequency intradiscal biacuplasty (IDB) for discogenic low back pain provides long-lasting relief, reported Leonardo Kapural, MD, PhD, from the Carolinas Pain Institute and Center for Clinical Research in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Discogenic pain is typically treatable only with surgical options, but IDB offers a noninvasive alternative that uses radiofrequency transdiscal electrodes to ablate sensory fibers in the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. The researcher team previously demonstrated the effectiveness of the treatment in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, sham study (Pain Med. 2013;14:362-373). In this new analysis, they report that with IDB, improvements at 6 months are maintained for as long as a year after the procedure. Image from Thinkstock No Difference by Injection Approach for Low Back Pain Transforaminal epidural steroid injections, despite being widely regarded as superior to interlaminar injections, are not significantly better at providing pain relief or functional improvement for radiating low back pain, a systematic review of trials indicates. \"I think these findings are definitely controversial, but I have had numerous people say to me that this is, in fact, very consistent with their experience,\" said lead author George Chang Chien, DO, from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. For their analysis, the researchers reviewed data from 8 trials — 5 prospective and 3 retrospective — with a total of 506 patients, including 249 (49%) who were followed for an average of 3.2 months. Interdisciplinary Fibromyalgia Treatment Benefits Sustained An intensive rehabilitation program led to clinically significant improvement in fibromyalgia that lasted up to 12 months after the program ended, according to a study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Center for Pain. The 3- to 4-week program involves treatment by professionals from multiple disciplines, including pain physicians, pain psychologists, physical and occupational therapists, group therapy, individual therapy, and biofeedback. \"This interdisciplinary approach doesn't cure fibromyalgia, but we have shown that it allows patients to become functional and have results that are sustained as long as a year after discharge. That is huge,\" said lead author Brinder Vij, MD, from the Cleveland Clinic. Cluster System Helps Categorize Fibromyalgia Severity Conference attendees heard about a proposed system of categorizing patients with fibromyalgia into cluster subsets on the basis of symptoms. This approach might help clinical fibromyalgia care, said Ann Vincent, MD, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"Intuitively, a cluster analysis of fibromyalgia patients makes sense because we see patients who fall into different categories of symptom severity,\" she said. In this system, cluster 1 represents the lowest severity and cluster 4 represents the highest. Patients in clusters 2 and 3, who had moderate symptoms, were further categorized into subsets. Patients in cluster 2 had lower levels of depression, anxiety, and dyscognition than those in cluster 3, but higher levels of pain, stiffness, dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. Image from Science Source Benzodiazepine, Opioid Prescribing Rises in Primary Care In primary care practices across the nation, benzodiazepines are being prescribed alone and in combination with opioids at increasing rates, meeting attendees heard. The trend is particularly alarming in light of the association between benzodiazepine-opioid combinations and prescription drug deaths, reported Ming-Chih Kao, MD, PhD, clinical assistant professor at Stanford University Medical Center in Cupertino, California. Statistics show that from 1999 to 2006, there was a 250% increase in fatal overdoses involving opioids in the United States, he said, and at least half of the overdoses involved more than 1 type of drug. Long-Term Opioid Use Likely After 90 Days in Veterans More than half of veterans who receive opioids go on to use the pain medications chronically, according to a study of nearly 1 million veterans receiving opioids. Study presenter Mark Sullivan, MD, PhD, from the University of Washington in Seattle, noted that although a high opioid dosage is a strong risk factor for chronic use, most long-term users in this population were, in fact, taking lower doses — around 20 mg. \"This is contradictory to what we see in the civilian population,\" he said. Pain specialist W. Michael Hooten, MD, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said he thinks that low doses \"strongly suggest that clinicians are aware of what they're doing. It sounds like they're actively trying to minimize dosages.\" Hormone Combo Reduces Pain, Opioid Dose in Intractable Pain Combining oxytocin and human chorionic gonadotropin can ease pain and reduce opioid doses in patients with intractable pain, results of a preliminary study hint. Seven of the 9 study participants who were maintained on 1 or more opioids cut their opioid dose by up to 40%, and had reductions from baseline in pain and flare intensity or an increase in the amount of time between flares, reported Forest Tennant, MD, from the Veract Intractable Pain Clinic in West Covina, California. The patients also reported improvements in energy level, mental function, mood, and libido. After being maintained on the therapy for 6 months, participants continued to report improvements. One pain specialist called the results intriguing, and definitely an \"interesting avenue to pursue.\" No Increases in Pain Seen With Opioid Dose Reductions For patients taking high-dose opioids, pain scores and aberrant drug behaviors are no worse after dose reductions than when doses are not reduced, a study has found. \"Despite significant reductions in their opioid doses and the fact that doses were often actually increased in the control group, the outcomes in areas of perceived functionality and aberrant behaviors were no different between the 2 groups,\" reported lead author David DiBenedetto, MD, from the Boston Pain Care Center in Waltham, Massachusetts. Pain specialist Forest Tennant, MD, from the Veract Intractable Pain Clinic in West Covina, California, didn't find the results surprising. \"What they've done is document a common observation, which is always worthwhile,\" he said. Wait Times for Spinal Cord Stimulation Vary by Specialty Delays reduce the success rate of spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain, and are much more common when patients are referred by anesthesiologists and orthopedic surgeons, a study shows. The mean time from the onset of the pain syndrome to the implantation of a stimulator was more than 5 years, and varied significantly by referring specialty. \"We need to educate physicians that spinal cord stimulation is a viable and effective treatment option for the management of chronic nonmalignant pain,\" said study presenter Krishna Kumar, MD, MBBS, clinical professor of neurosurgery at the University of Saskatchewan in Regina, Canada. \"It is necessary to initiate spinal cord stimulation early in the pain care continuum — prior to changes occurring in the brain — to improve success rates.\" For more information: Medscape news coverage of AAPM 2014 Medscape Neurology American Academy of Pain Medicine Related slideshows Top News From AAPM 2013: Slideshow Top News From AAPM 2012: Slideshow More Slideshows CLOSE WINDOW Contributor Information Megan Brooks Freelance Journalist Weston, Connecticut Susan Jeffrey Neurology News Editor London, Ontario, Canada Allison Shelley Medscape Conference News Editor Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Geoff Reed Freelance Photographer Phoenix Darbe Rotach Medscape Senior Photo Editor New York City Nancy Melville Freelance Journalist Phoenix CLOSE WINDOW References -->-->-->-->-->-->-->-->-->   Find Us On Group 2 34A8E98B-62ED-4216-98D6-E986304F4C2E About About Medscape Privacy Policy Terms of Use Advertising Policy Help Center Membership Become a Member Email Newsletters Manage My Account Apps Medscape MedPulse News CME & Education WebMD Network WebMD MedicineNet eMedicineHealth RxList WebMD Corporate Editions English Deutsch Español Français Português All material on this website is protected by copyright, Copyright © 1994-2017 by WebMD LLC.

				"body": "Abstract and Introduction Abstract and Introduction Abstract Acetaminophen has recently been recognized as having impacts that extend into the affective domain. In particular, double blind placebo controlled trials have revealed that acetaminophen reduces the magnitude of reactivity to social rejection, frustration, dissonance and to both negatively and positively valenced attitude objects. Given this diversity of consequences, it has been proposed that the psychological effects of acetaminophen may reflect a widespread blunting of evaluative processing. We tested this hypothesis using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixty-two participants received acetaminophen or a placebo in a double-blind protocol and completed the Go/NoGo task. Participants' ERPs were observed following errors on the Go/NoGo task, in particular the error-related negativity (ERN; measured at FCz) and error-related positivity (Pe; measured at Pz and CPz). Results show that acetaminophen inhibits the Pe, but not the ERN, and the magnitude of an individual's Pe correlates positively with omission errors, partially mediating the effects of acetaminophen on the error rate. These results suggest that recently documented affective blunting caused by acetaminophen may best be described as an inhibition of evaluative processing. They also contribute to the growing work suggesting that the Pe is more strongly associated with conscious awareness of errors relative to the ERN. Introduction Long used as an analgesic and antipyretic, acetaminophen (paracetamol)––or Tylenol, as its brand name is more commonly known––has recently been recognized as having impacts that extend into the affective domain. In particular, double-blind placebo controlled trials have revealed that acetaminophen reduces the magnitude of reactivity to social pain and frustration (Dewall et al. , 2010), dissonance and existential anxiety triggered by unsettling experiences (Randles et al. , 2013; Dewall et al. , 2015), and to both negatively and positively valenced attitude objects (Durso et al. , 2015). Given this diversity of consequences, it has recently been proposed that the psychological effects of acetaminophen are not specific to the affective domain, but instead reflect a more widespread blunting of evaluative processing in general (Durso et al. , 2015). If this hypothesis is correct, acetaminophen should be able to inhibit or interfere with cognitive signals associated with evaluative processing. We test this by focusing on two event-related potentials (ERPs) that emerge in cortex in quick temporal succession following a choice response error: the error-related negativity (ERN) and positivity (Pe). Converging evidence suggests that a general conflict detection mechanism in the brain supports cognitive control (Botvinick et al. , 2004). Conflict itself is defined as any disagreement or discrepancy between mental representations, response tendencies or actual behavior (Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Botvinick et al. , 2004). This system scrutinizes the moment-to-moment representations of action tendencies for potential conflicts, so that inhibitory mechanisms may be engaged to override the unwanted tendency and promote effective goal pursuit. The ERN/Pe ERP complex appears to signal activity of this conflict detection system. The ERN emerges 0–100 ms post-error and is typically maximal at frontal-central midline electrode sites (Falkenstein et al. , 1990; Gehring et al. , 1993), with the Pe following at 180–350 ms post-response, emerging more clearly along parietal-central midline sites (Hajcak et al. , 2003; Santesso et al. , 2005; Steinhauser and Young, 2010). While both ERN and Pe components follow from errors, they are at least partially independent. The ERN is clearly a correlate of evaluative processing (e.g. Hajcak and Foti, 2008; Hobson et al. , 2014), but is more strongly associated with an initial, somewhat automatic or implicit monitoring of the error (e.g., Gehring et al. , 1993; Falkenstein et al. , 2000; Endrass et al. , 2005; Overbeek et al. , 2005). Some have argued that it is only a precursor to the Pe, which is believed to reflect a more overt awareness and evaluative analysis of the error (e.g., Overbeek et al. , 2005; Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010; Boldt and Yeung, 2015). For instance, awareness of an error is often uniquely predicted by the Pe and task salience relates to Pe magnitude, while the ERN is triggered by both aware and unaware errors (Endrass et al. , 2005; Overbeek et al. 2005). While both ERP components are associated with post-error slowing, the relationship emerges more consistently for the Pe (e.g. Hajcak et al. , 2003; D'Lauro and Curran, 2007; cf. Ullsperger et al. , 2010 for a review). Additionally, the Pe appears to be uniquely associated with error-related EMG activity over the corrugator, which has been associated with orienting toward motivationally important events (Elkins-Brown et al. , 2015), as well as peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity (Hajcak et al. , 2003). Using dipole-modeling techniques, the ERN has been most consistently localized in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), most likely in the dorsal region (dACC; Herrmann et al. , 2004). Less work has focused specifically on the Pe, with the data that exists suggesting a more distributed source. Some research has localized the Pe to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, (van Veen et al. , 2002; Herrmann et al. , 2004; Taylor et al. , 2007), whereas other work identifies the parietal cortex as responsible for generating the signal (Falkenstein et al. , 2000; Davies et al. , 2001). In line with the perspective of an integrated conflict-detection system, the ACC shows consistent activation in response to a range of distressing experiences, such as social rejection (Eisenberger, 2015) and pain (cf. Shackman et al. , 2011; Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2015). One study has found that acetaminophen inhibits social rejection over a 2-week period, as well as ACC activity following a rejection manipulation in-lab (Dewall et al. , 2010). This work, combined with behavioral studies indicating acetaminophen inhibits dissonance reduction (also associated with ACC activity; van Veen et al. , 2009; Izuma et al. , 2010; DeWall et al. , 2015) and broader evaluative processes (Durso et al. , 2015), suggests that acetaminophen may inhibit neural processes involved in evaluating any conflict. As the ERN/Pe consistently emerges as a correlate of conflict and error detection, acetaminophen may inhibit this signal following conflict events. In the following study, we conducted a double-blind placebo controlled acetaminophen trial that had participants perform a two-choice, Go/NoGo target detection task while we measured their brain electrical responses via the electroencephalogram. Given research to date on the ERN/Pe response, we hypothesized that acetaminophen may interfere with early bottom-up processing of error-related cognition, or may only affect downstream processes associated with bringing that information to conscious awareness. As such, we anticipated that acetaminophen may or may not reduce the amplitude of the ERN, but should reduce the amplitude of the Pe elicited by response errors. Materials and Methods Materials and Methods Participants Sixty-two students (44 women, mean age = 19.42, s.d. = 1.85) were recruited from The University of British Columbia. Participants were mostly East Asian ( N = 31) or Western European ( N = 17), with the remaining participants from other or mixed ethnic backgrounds. Eight participants' ERP data were excluded from analysis due to equipment failure, excessive blinking or producing fewer than five no-go errors throughout the task (Olvet and Hajcak, 2009). The mean number of no-go errors was 19.71 (s.d. = 7.47). All 62 participants were used for analyses that only require self-report or behavioral measures. We aimed to collect data for thirty useable participants per condition; data collection was terminated at the end of the academic term. The study finished with n = 33 participants in the acetaminophen condition ( n = 28 included in the ERP analysis) and n = 29 in the placebo condition ( n = 26 included in the ERP analysis). Stimuli and Task Participants performed the go/no-go task, which is commonly used to measure response inhibition. Participants were instructed to hit a button as quickly as possible in response to the 'go' stimulus, but withhold their response to a similar-looking but different 'no-go' stimulus. The 'go' stimulus was presented 80% of the time, randomly assigned to each trial with non-replacement, ensuring that all participants completed 240 'go' and 60 'no-go' trials. The 300 trials were broken into six blocks of 50 trials each, with a brief rest period in between each block. The stimuli used were the letters F and E, counter-balanced between participants regarding the stimulus assigned as 'go' and 'no-go'. Each trial began with the presentation of a central fixation dot that randomly varied between 200 and 600 ms, followed by a stimulus presented for 100 ms. Participants had up to 600 ms from the onset of the stimulus to respond, followed by a blank screen used for the inter-trial interval, randomly varied between 0 and 200 ms. Stimulus onset asynchrony therefore varied between 900 and 1500 ms. No feedback was given during the task. Experimental Manipulation Participants in the experimental condition consumed two capsules containing 500 mg tablets of Kirkland-brand acetaminophen (1000 mg total). The placebo condition consumed two identical-looking capsules that were filled with sugar. Participants were randomly assigned to condition through a double-blind procedure, where each participant's dose was assigned a unique ID prior to the study that matched it to the correct condition. The researcher running the study did not have direct access to the list that associated IDs with condition, but could request access to identify the condition if it became medically necessary. Participants were sorted into condition beginning at the group averaging stage of analysis. Procedure Participants provided written consent and then consumed their assigned capsules. After a brief waiting period (30 min) the researcher placed the electroencephalogram electrodes over the participants' scalp, and sat them in front of a computer monitor to begin the go/no-go task. This task always began 60 min after consuming the pills, ensuring that most participants experienced peak pharmacological activation; typically requiring 45–60 min for adults consuming acetaminophen orally (Bertolini et al. , 2006). When this task was completed, participants completed the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) asking how they felt at that moment (∝ = 0.87 for positive and ∝ = 0.77 for negative items), exploratory measures, suspicion-check items, and finally a second administration of the PANAS (∝ = .88 for positive and ∝ = 0.87 for negative items) that asked how they were feeling specifically while completing the go/no-go. We additionally included three extra items in both versions of the PANAS: Frustrated, anxious, and unpleasant (along with 'attentive' which is already in the PANAS). The second PANAS administration and added words were used to address concerns raised by Spunt et al. (2012) that people are better able to articulate their feelings relative to an actual event and that these particular words were more informative than a broad survey of negative affect. EEG Recording and Analysis Continuous EEG was recorded during the task using 64 Ag/AgCl active electrodes (BioSemi Active-Two amplifier system) in accordance with the international 10–20 system. Two additional electrodes located over the medial-parietal cortex (Common Mode Sense and Driven Right Leg) were used as ground electrodes. Recordings were digitized at 256 Hz, digitally filtered offline between 0.1 and 30 Hz (zero phase-shift Butterworth filter) and then referenced offline to the average of two mastoid electrodes. EEG data processing was performed using ERPLAB, a toolbox within MATLAB used in conjunction with EEGLAB. To ensure proper eye fixation and allow for the removal of events associated with eye movement artifacts, vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EOGs) were also recorded—the vertical EOGs from an electrode inferior to the right eye, and the horizontal EOGs from two electrodes on the right and left outer canthus. Offline, computerized artifact rejection was used to eliminate trials during which detectable eye movements and blinks occurred. These eye artifacts were detected by identifying the minimum and maximum voltage values on all recorded EOG channels from − 200 to 800 ms post-stimulus for each event epoch, and then removing the trial from subsequent signal averaging if that value exceeded 200 μV, a value calibrated to capture all blinks and saccades. This was followed by visual inspection of the data. If additional artifacts (e.g. muscle movements and loose connections) were observed, the threshold was reduced by 25 μV until artifacts were not present or a minimum of 100 μV was reached. An average of 13.34% (s.d. = 12.94%) of the total number of correct trials across participants and 21.62% (s.d. = 19.7%) of the incorrect trials were rejected due to these signal artifacts. The percentage of trials rejected did not significantly differ between the acetaminophen and placebo conditions (both t s &lt; 1, P s &gt; 0.25). Continuous data were segmented into 800 ms epochs, time-locked to response and were baseline-corrected by subtracting the average voltage during the time period −200 to −50 ms prior to response. This baseline window was used to avoid subtracting out the ERN component, which often is visible up to 50 ms prior to recording of the response (e.g. Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, 2012). These epochs were averaged within participants independently for correct button-presses (i.e. correct 'go's) and incorrect button presses (i.e. responding to 'no-go's; commission errors) and then grand-averaged across participants within the respective conditions. Results Results Behavior Data and analysis scripts are available for download from the Open Science Framework at . Reaction times (RTs) and error rates are reported in Table 1 by group. To assess effects on the number of errors made, we used negative binomial regression with a log link function for all analyses. This analysis employs a distribution that fits count data well (such as number of errors made), anticipating a distribution that is extremely right-skewed and over-dispersed (i.e. the variance of errors is greater than the mean; as was the case in our study). Regarding errors of commission (a go response on no-go trials), acetaminophen did not predict more erroneous button presses, χ 2 (1,60) = 1.56, P = 0.21, ln( b ) = −0.13 CI 0.975 [−0.33 to 0.07]. However, the acetaminophen group made significantly more errors of omission, allowing a larger number of 'go' trials to pass by without entering a response, χ 2 (1,60) = 11.56, P &lt; 0.001, ln( b ) = 0.76 CI 0.975 [0.32 to 1.19]. Finally, to examine post-error slowing (a common response in cognitive RT tasks that reflects behavioral adjustment in response to the error), we calculated the average RT for go trials following a no-go error, minus the average RT for a go trial following a no-go success. Although a clear post-error slowing effect emerged for the entire sample, (tested against 0) t (61) = 9.39, P &lt; 0.001, d = 2.4 CI 0.975 [1.89 to 2.91], there was no significant difference between groups, t (59.7) = 1.28, P = 0.20 d = 0.33 CI 0.975 [−0.19 to 0.85]. Electrophysiology The ERN was defined as the mean amplitude of the negative deflection occurring 0–100 ms post-response, at FCz (e.g., Hajcak et al. , 2003; Santesso et al. , 2005; Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010; Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, 2012). The Pe was measured as the mean amplitude of the positive deflection from 180 to 350 ms post-response, using the average of CPz and Pz (Hajcak et al. , 2003; Santesso et al. , 2005). In order to isolate the neural response specifically elicited by an error, we computed difference waveforms to control for activity elicited by a motor response. Difference waveforms were obtained by subtracting the waveforms for correct presses from the waveforms for incorrect presses (Luck, 2005). Unprocessed ERP waveforms are available in the supplementary online material ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). Topographical maps of the difference waves confirm the choice of electrodes used in the analyses (see Figure 1) As per standard for the ERN waveform, all measures were made relative to a −200 to −50 pre-stimulus baseline. Figure 1. Topographical maps of the difference waves. Three participants from the acetaminophen group and one from the placebo were removed before constructing topographical maps. They had at least one electrode failure not critical to the primary hypothesis, with average magnitudes over 4 s.d. from the group mean (Failed electrodes ranged between 172 and 7746 absolute μV). Figure 1: Topographical maps of the difference waves... The ERN and Pe difference waveforms are shown in Figure 2 by group, and mean amplitude measures are reported in Table 2 . For all tests, a correction for non-equal variance was applied to the degrees of freedom, although in most cases the assumption of equal variance was met. Comparing between the acetaminophen and placebo groups, there was no significant difference in the ERN measured at FCz, t (48.3) = 1.56, P = 0.13, d = 0.45 CI 0.975 [−0.13 to 1.03], but there was a significant reduction in the magnitude of the Pe measured at CPz/Pz in the acetaminophen condition, t (51.8) = 2.32, P = 0.02, d = 0.65 CI 0.975 [0.09 to 1.2]. Figure 2. Difference waveforms for placebo and acetaminophen groups. Note for both figures: Difference waveforms were constructed by subtracting the ERP for a correct button press from the ERP for an incorrect button press. Dashed lines represent 95% CI. Mean amplitude for the ERN was measured at FCz across 0–100 ms. Mean amplitude of Pe (180–350 ms) measured at CPz and Pz. Figure 2: Difference waveforms for placebo... Toward understanding the relationship between observed behavioral and ERP effects, we conducted several additional analyses. First, errors of commission were not predicted by the amplitude of an individual's ERN (χ 2 (1,52) = 0.22, P &gt; 0.25, ln( b ) = 0.01 CI 0.975 [−0.02 to 0.03]) or Pe (χ 2 (1,52) = 0.07, P &gt; 0.25, ln( b ) = 0.00 CI 0.975 [−0.02 to 0.02]). However, individual differences in Pe amplitude predicted fewer errors of omission as amplitude increased (χ 2 (1,52) = 11.02, P &lt; 0.001, ln( b ) = −0.06 CI 0.975 [−0.10 to −0.03]. While this effect remained marginally significant when controlling for condition χ 2 (1,52) = 3.31, P = 0.07, ln( b ) = −0.03 CI 0.975 [−0.07 to 0.003], a bootstrap analysis of the indirect effect of acetaminophen on errors through inhibited Pe activity was significant (10 000 resamples, bias corrected and accelerated CI 0.975 [0.012 to 1.37]; Preacher and Hayes, 2008), indicating partial mediation of acetaminophen's effect on omission error rates via reduced Pe activity. In contrast, individual differences in ERN magnitude failed to predict these errors, χ 2 (1,51) = 1.43, P &gt; 0.25, ln( b) = 0.03 CI 0.975 [−0.05 to 0.07]. Further, there was no correlation between post-error slowing and either magnitude of the ERN, P &gt; 0.25, r = −0.01 CI 0.975 [−0.29 to 0.27]), or Pe, P &gt; 0.25, r = −0.08 CI 0.975 [−0.36 to 0.20]. Control Analyses Given our study design and question, we conducted two additional control analyses. First, as a check of the double-blind protocol, we asked participants to report what type of pill they believed they had received, and whether they were confident in their guess. Only 6.7% claimed they were confident (three in the acetaminophen group, and one in the placebo group), and guesses were correct 56.45% of the time (not different from chance, P &gt; 0.25). Although neither group was more accurate at guessing their condition (both P s &gt; 0.25), all participants who were confident guessed correctly, suggesting that for a small minority (possibly those experiencing mild pain before the study) it was at least somewhat possible to detect whether they had been given a placebo or the drug. Using participants' perceived group, we found no significant differences on any of our key dependent variables (i.e. no placebo effect; see Supplementary Table S1 in the supplementary online materials ). Second, to account for possible impacts of acetaminophen on affect, we had participants complete the PANAS. Regarding conscious change in affect, there were no differences between conditions regarding positive or negative affect, regardless of whether the PANAS was presented immediately after the go/no-go task and referred to their mood in general, or whether it was presented later and had the participant report their mood in reference to when they were completing the go/-no-go task, all t s &lt; 0.5, P s &gt; 0.25. There was also no difference for either measure when focusing on just the new items recommended by Spunt et al. (2012), both t s &lt; 1.0, P s &gt; 0.25. While participants may have been experiencing brief immediate affective reactions to errors, acetaminophen did not impact their affective state either immediately after the entire task, or after an additional delay. Discussion Discussion Our study assessed the hypothesis that acetaminophen, previously linked to a range of affect-related impacts (e.g. Dewall et al. , 2010, 2015; Randles et al. , 2013), inhibits evaluative processing in a more domain-general manner (Durso et al. , 2015). In this regard, we found that not only was acetaminophen associated with reduced Pe activity in a visual go/no-go task, it also led to a systematic reduction in the propensity to detect and respond to targets relative to a placebo control group, possibly indicating inhibited evaluative analysis of errors. This suggests that the psychological effects of acetaminophen are not limited to the social-affective domain, but consistent with the predictions of Durso et al. (2015), they extend to more basic evaluative processes in cortex, and in particular, those associated with performance monitoring. Beyond this immediate conclusion, several additional points follow. First, our ERP data confirm an important theoretical prediction regarding basic cognitive functioning that, paradoxically, has arisen from the social psychology literature. Specifically, our results build on the growing evidence pointing to the role of aversive arousal motivating cognitive control (Elkins-Brown et al. , 2015; Inzlicht et al. , 2015; Saunders et al. , 2015). Given that acetaminophen has previously been shown to attenuate social strife and dissonance associated with situational uncertainty (DeWall et al. , 2010, 2015; Randles et al. , 2013) the demonstration here is that error monitoring is similarly impacted. This indicates that, while this trio of domains can involve very different content and modalities, they share a common underlying challenge of updating information and altering behavior, and thus may be processed in a similar neural manner as a result. Second, our findings provide novel insight into the basic cortical mechanisms associated with error and performance monitoring. In particular, there has been intense on-going debate regarding what specifically the ERN and Pe respectively capture about these vital cortical processes (e.g. Falkenstein et al. , 2000; Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Endrass et al. , 2005; Overbeek et al. , 2005; O'Connell et al. , 2007; Vocat et al. , 2008; Shalgi et al. , 2009). Toward resolving this debate, recent evidence using signal-detection modeling has shown that whereas the Pe is sensitive to one's subjective criteria for a perceptual decision and confidence in the decision made, the ERN is not (Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010; Boldt and Yeung, 2015). As such, our results expand on this behavioral dissociation in two critical ways. We show that the Pe and ERN can be dissociated psychopharmacologically in a manner consistent with this general functional interpretation. Additionally, the sensitivity of the Pe to acetaminophen we report here suggests these processes may have at least some functional overlap with the broader array of affective-evaluative processes previously linked to attenuation via acetaminophen (Dewall et al. , 2010; Randles et al. , 2013; Durso et al. , 2015; Inzlicht et al. , 2015). With regards to this distinction however, additional follow-up work should be completed. As this was the first ERP study to use acetaminophen as a manipulation, and given our null ERN finding, we may have failed to detect an effect for the ERN that may be revealed with larger samples. Third, the effect of acetaminophen on errors of omission, while robust, was unanticipated. Given that RTs between groups were not different for Go trials (once omissions were excluded), it suggests that acetaminophen may be affecting the depth of our attentional engagement with events in the external environment, in a manner akin to what is observed during episodes of mind wandering, when our cognitive and affective sensitivity to task-relevant events decreases (e.g. Kam and Handy, 2013; Handy and Kam, 2015). This possibility is consistent with evidence from functional neuroimaging indicating that brief attentional lapses in simple choice RT tasks are associated with transient decreases in pre-stimulus activity in the ACC (Weissman et al. , 2006), the key brain region presumably affected by acetaminophen. However, without further evidence, this remains a speculative interpretation. Finally, our findings also raise a pair of more practical implications regarding the neurocognitive consequences of acetaminophen. For one, as our study and others have now demonstrated, it represents a potentially novel and previously unrecognized approach for psychopharmacologically manipulating cortical evaluative processes in the laboratory, relevant to reinforcement schedules (Pfabigan et al. , 2010), directed attention (Hauswald et al. , 2011) and other tasks known to be associated with Pe activity. For another, our results suggest a need for greater awareness regarding the potential neurocognitive side-effects of acetaminophen. Participants made more errors under the influence of acetaminophen, an effect that was partially mediated by reduced Pe magnitude. Cognitive control is constantly required throughout an individual's day. Whether operating complex machinery, coordinating teams of individuals, or driving a car, cognitive control is important for quickly and accurately responding to everyday challenges. Additional studies monitoring different types of tasks, and under more ecologically valid conditions, will help to verify the magnitude of the real-world effect of this medication. ",

				"body": "SAN DIEGO — Intavenous ibuprofen (IV) ibuprofen is more effective than acetaminophen administered orally or by suppository at reducing fever in pediatric patients, according to the results of a new study. \"For patients who can't take oral medications, IV Tylenol [acetaminophen] has been available for a couple of years, but we haven't had an intravenous ibuprofen product available that has been studied in children,\" Corrie Chumpitazi, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics in the emergency medicine section at the Baylor College of Medicine Texas Children's Hospital, in Houston, told Medscape Medical News. IV ibuprofen gained FDA approval in 2009, but until now it had only been studied in adults for fever and pain, not in pediatric populations. Dr Chumpitazi presented the study results here at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2014 National Conference and Exhibition. The researchers compared IV ibuprofen to oral or suppository acetaminophen in children aged 6 months to 16 years with new-onset fever of 38.3º C or higher. The multicenter study enrolled 100 patients. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 dose of 10 mg/kg IV ibuprofen (n = 47; maximum single dose, 400 mg) or 10 mg/kg acetaminophen (n = 53; maximum single dose, 650 mg), delivered orally or as a suppository. During the following 5 days, patients received additional doses of medication as needed. The researchers analyzed the area under the curve for temperature change plotted against time after the dose was administered. Between 0 and 2 hours, the area under the curve was significantly decreased in the IV ibuprofen group (-1.5 ± 1.11 ibuprofen vs -0.9 ± 0.89 acetaminophen, P = .012). Fever Gone At 4 hours, 91% of patients receiving IV ibuprofen no longer had a fever, compared with 75% of those receiving acetaminophen ( P = .036). Eleven percent of patients receiving IV ibuprofen experienced some infusion site pain. The study showed a similar serious adverse effect profile for IV ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but the study was not powered to demonstrate safety. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that peak fever in patients receiving IV ibuprofen occurred at the end of the infusion, and the drug had a short half-life (0.79 - 2.87 hours; mean, 1.55 hours). \"I'm excited about the results within the fever population. I'm also excited for further studies looking at it for pain reduction as well,\" said Dr Chumpitazi. Additional studies are also necessary to ensure that the side-effect profile of IV ibuprofen is acceptable, she added. The study is interesting, but may not apply to the emergency setting, said Elliott Harris, MD, an associate professor of emergency medicine for pediatrics at Cooper University Hospital, in Camden, New Jersey, who attended the presentation. That's because the dose used, 10 mg/kg, is lower than that typically used in the emergency department, where a single dose of 15 mg/kg is more commonly employed. And, he added, many patients in an emergency setting will not be put on an IV. Still, he thinks the drug could be a useful alternative. \"A lot of times, you have someone who is not able to take oral medications for whatever reason, and it gives you something that you can use for fever or pain. Although there are certainly other medications you can use for pain, your options for fever management are more limited,\" Dr Elliott told Medscape Medical News. He added that he would like to see more studies investigating whether the intravenous route of delivery alters the efficacy of the drug. \"Is there any difference in how the ibuprofen works when given intravenously vs orally?\" he asked. \"Does one work quicker than the other? Is there a different side-effect profile.\" The study was funded by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, which markets intravenous ibuprofen. Neither Dr Chumpitazi nor Dr Elliott has reported any relevant financial relationships. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2014 National Conference and Exhibition. Abstract 27404.

				"body": "I awoke on that fateful Wednesday morning with a vaguely familiar discomfort, an annoying pinching pain in my left flank that originated from somewhere deep in my lower lumbar spine. It radiated down to my left groin onto the medial aspect of my left thigh. The pain pushed forward into my left lower quadrant, persistent and annoying. I was neither nauseated nor febrile. I had no bowel complaints. Ignoring the long-held notion that the physician who treats or tries to diagnose herself is a fool, I stretched out on the bed for a self–exam: \"Hmm . . . nontender abdomen, certainly no rebound pain, no bloating; bowel sounds are normal, yet my flank is killing me. What the heck?\" For three days, I held the pain at bay with a heating pad and rarely a Tylenol. Oddly, naproxen sodium did absolutely nothing for the discomfort. Between patients, I phoned the urologist on call, thinking I might have a kidney stone, but my urine was clear. After a long Friday at the office, I went home, ate a little supper, and after my husband fell asleep, the pain escalated beyond any I have ever experienced. I've had two C-sections, one preceded by 10 hours of hard labor and the other by 36 hours of moderate labor pain. I walked the floor from 10:30 PM until the following morning. For some stupid reason, around 2 AM , maddened with pain, I thought it might help if I got on the bed and put my head on the floor. It was kind of comical when I slipped off the bed and hit my head on a nice cushy wool rug I'd bought earlier in the year. \"Jeez, I almost knocked myself out,\" I said, laughing and grimacing at the same time, trying not to wake my husband, who missed a great opportunity for good-natured ribbing. Finally, at 5 AM I pulled the trigger on the scenario and woke him. \"Honey, you have to take me to the ER. I'm dying,\" I said standing over him, wincing in pain. Saturday at 6 AM is a great time to go to the ER. The Friday-night drunks, rebel rousers, and drug seekers are already upstairs, in jail, or home prepping for Saturday night. No one in their right mind who isn't sick, injured, or in pain is going to show up at an emergency department early on a Saturday morning. We were taken back immediately. \"I think I'm about to perforate my bowel again,\" I told the ER doctor, still trying to self-diagnose, \"or perhaps I'm trying to pass a kidney stone,\" I offered. He examined me, ordered a U/A and a CBC, did a CT scan, and scratched his head. A few hours later, he suggested I go home with some pain meds, but my husband, who knows I abhor even a single Tylenol, was worried and suggested a surgical consult. Two hours later, the pain was an embarrassing 9/10 (I reserve unmedicated dental pain or decapitation for a 10/10 rating), but not wanting to seem wimpy, I declined pain meds again. The surgeon admitted me and requested a GI consult. The ER nurse, probably an army sergeant in another life, practically forced me to reveal my IV. For 90 minutes, I was in Dilaudid heaven. It was the best feeling I've ever had, but at the two-hour mark, the pain recurred with a vengeance. \"May I have another, please?\" I asked in resignation. I was quickly obliged but soon began to vomit, either from the pain or from the Dilaudid. I didn't know which and I didn't care. Pain relief, nausea, then recurrent pain became a never-ending cycle. A Diagnosis at Last Over the course of the next few days, a gastroenterologist performed a normal sigmoidoscopy and my internist ordered an MRI of my L-spine, which was also normal. I vaguely remember asking my loving 83-year-old mom to call Michael Jackson 's former doctor . She sat worried at the bedside watching her eldest child writhe in pain as I reasoned that Conrad Murray was currently out of work. I would have kindly allowed him to stand outside the door and text as many girlfriends as he wanted as long as he left the good stuff running. I wanted relief, and I didn't care if it killed me. It scares me that in the moment after all those hours of pain, I think I really meant it. My family and the hospital team were at wit's end. There was a seemingly endless parade of compassionate nurses who had honed my daily routine of IV Zofran 30 minutes prior to 2-mg IV Dilaudid every two hours with hydrocodone po every four hours. Everything was garnished with clear liquids and Jell-O. Finally, my husband (who is not a medical professional), while helping me to the bathroom, asked, \"What is that all over your side?\" I gingerly raised the top of my favorite comfy PJs and rolled my eyes, exclaiming in disbelief. \"OH MY GOSH, this has just been shingles all along?\" I stood dumbfounded, peering down at the shotgun-blast distribution of red lesions running in the exact distribution of the pain, and I felt deeply ashamed. \"I must be a real wimp,\" I said to my internist and my surgeon, who came by shaking their heads, but with relief, admitting that they too had been fooled. Acyclovir was initiated immediately, and within two days, pain meds were switched to po. Finally, on day 5 of the hospitalization, I was discharged. It had taken nearly a week for those stubborn and cowardly lesions to reveal themselves. The pain quickly morphed into something more manageable but completely different. It felt like a sunburn but was punctuated intermittently with the stabbing pain of a thousand tiny needles. At postdischarge day 4, I switched to extra-strength Tylenol. A week later I returned to work wearing the largest, least form-fitting clothing I could find. Anytime fabric brushed across my flesh, it awakened that fiery sleeping dragon for several minutes. Finding a comfortable sleeping position was impossible. If I rolled onto my left side, I woke up hurting for a good 20 minutes. The sensation of the skin covering my left flank would not return to normal for about five weeks, resulting in sleep deprivation for the duration. I relied heavily upon my friend from Keurig (coffee) for that much-needed shot of energy. I welcomed the exacerbated benign palpitations just to help me work competently during the day. As for my office routine, adjustments were necessary to protect my patients. I requested that my secretaries and techs reschedule those who could not recall a history of chicken pox or who had not been vaccinated. Scores of issues were handled by phone. Two pregnant patients were rescheduled just as a precaution. Another pregnant patient made it into an exam room, but I quickly pulled my hand off the doorknob when I saw her name. I stepped into my office and called her on the phone in the exam room explaining the situation. Many patients on chemo were advised to reschedule. A few patients were just plain old afraid of me and backed out of the office before they could even receive adequate education on my diagnosis. As for the ones I saw during that five weeks, we had many interesting conversations. \"Why didn't you take the vaccine?\" many patients asked, to which I replied, \"The FDA approved it for patients above the age of 50, but the CDC recommended it in patients older than 60, so I didn't take it,\" I replied. \"I've had it three times,\" one patient complained. Another related that her neighbor had shingles seven years ago and \"he still hurts all the time,\" (which really encouraged me, of course). \"My mother had it in her eye and she had to see the eye specialist,\" another said. A colleague of mine contacted me by Facebook and said his shingles produced such severe chest pain that he underwent a cardiac cath. Two patients told me matter-of-factly, \"If your shingles ever meet in the middle, you're done for.\" (So much for reverse bedside manner!) \"I had it and it wasn't so bad,\" one patient bragged. My poor mother had shingles years ago on parts usually unmentionable, except she was in enough pain that she mentioned them plenty, but I still didn't get it. Despite my years of internal-medicine training and 23 years in private practice in cardiology, I never really understood how severe shingles pain can be. Now I want to pay my newfound knowledge forward. I want to help you to avoid such misery, so read on. CDC Vaccine Advice The CDC website is an excellent resource. Please pass along the following information to your friends, family members and patients: In a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older, Zostavax (Merck) reduced the risk of shingles by about half (51%) and the risk of postherpetic neuralgia by 67%. While the vaccine was most effective in people 60 to 69 years old, it also provided some protection for older groups. Research suggests that the shingles vaccine is effective for at least six years but may last longer. Ongoing studies are being conducted to determine how long the vaccine protects against shingles. The CDC recommends Zostavax for use in people 60 years old and older to prevent shingles. This is a one-time vaccination. There is no maximum age for getting the shingles vaccine. Anyone 60 years of age or older should get the shingles vaccine, regardless of whether they recall having had chickenpox or not. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans ages 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember getting the disease. The vaccine is available in pharmacies and doctor's offices. Talk with your healthcare professional if you have questions about the shingles vaccine. At this time, the CDC does not have a recommendation for routine use of shingles vaccine in persons 50 through 59 years old. However, the vaccine is approved by FDA for people in this age group. Even if you have had shingles, you can still receive the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine. The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your healthcare provider. Generally, a person should make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. In 1990, a cardiology fellow in our training program suggested to a patient that her severe pain, deemed noncardiac, might turn out to be shingles. She was livid that he would even consider it a possibility, called him an idiot, and went as far as to write a letter of complaint to our chairperson. Looking back, his observation was sheer genius. Wish I'd remembered that scenario on that fateful Wednesday morning as I lay on my bed, pushing on my belly and asking, \"What the heck?\" Please remember, the next time you scratch your head and question the source of someone's pain, that shingles, that great masquerader, might just be the answer.

Unfortunately, the new 500 mg packet is virtually indistinguishable from Tylenol 325 mg packets (see photo). While the bar code is an important safety improvement, the striking package similarities will likely lead to mix-ups and possibly excessive dosing in facilities that don't utilize point-of-care bar coding, especially since the manufacturer, McNeil, did not notify customers about the packaging change. McNeil is aware of the problem and exploring ways to better differentiate the two strengths. For now, some health providers are purchasing the 500 mg strength of acetaminophen from a generic manufacturer so it looks different. Figure 1.

				"body": "Nine of 10 intrauterine device (IUD) insertions in women who have not borne children were uneventful, according to a study by researchers in Finland, published online July 7 in Obstetrics & Gynecology . \"Ultrasonographic evaluation does not give additional information compared with clinical pelvic examination and sound measure,\" Janina Kaislasuo, MD, from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland, and colleagues write. \"Although smaller uterine length measurements and steeper flexion angle more often predicted difficulties, the majority of insertions were uneventful in women with small measures. Dysmenorrhea was the only predictor of pain.\" IUD size and shape, as well as uterine size, may all influence successful IUD insertion, the authors write. Women who have not borne children usually have smaller intrauterine spaces. Fear of insertion pain and difficulty may discourage women from using IUDs, as well as physicians from recommending them. From January 1, 2011, to July 3, 2012, researchers enrolled 165 women at a family planning clinic in Helsinki, Finland. Women who had never borne children and who were requesting their first IUD were offered either a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD or a copper-releasing IUD. The researchers obtained menstrual and gynecologic histories through interviews and performed pelvic exams with vaginal ultrasound. All women received standard pain medication before IUD insertion. A single experienced physician inserted all IUDs. Both the patient and physician rated insertion pain immediately after the procedure, and the physician rated ease of insertion. Most insertions (n = 144 [89.4%]) were \"easy.\" Insertion difficulty decreased for each millimeter increase in uterine length (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 - 0.96; P = .006) and cervical length (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 - 0.97; P = .02). Ease of insertion also increased with a straighter uterine flexion angle (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 - 0.99; P = .005). No significant differences regarding ease of insertion were found between the 2 types of IUDs. All women reported insertion pain, with more than half describing it as \"severe\" (n = 94 [58.4%]). Severe dysmenorrhea was the only predictor of insertion pain (OR, 8.16; 95% CI, 2.56 - 26.02; P < .001). The physician \"commonly\" rated pain 1 step milder than the woman ( P < .001). The authors mention past studies suggesting that pain assessed immediately after insertion is significantly greater than at 3 minutes. Dysmenorrhea, they add, is linked to increased uterine contractility and changes in blood flow. Altered central nervous system pain responses, immune factors, and steroid hormones could also play roles. Reversing vasoconstriction with prostaglandins, they mention, could help decrease the pain. \"[I]dentifying means of sufficient analgesia for these women is important,\" the authors conclude. \"Equally important is counseling women coming to IUD insertion and proper insertion technique, including clinical evaluation by palpation and sound measure. However, ultrasound evaluation before insertion does not give additional information and must not limit access to IUD use.\" \"A smaller uterine length and steeper flexion angle will more often predict difficulties with IUD insertion than ultrasound,\" William Schweizer, MD, clinical associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at New York University Langone Medical Center, New York City, told Medscape Medical News . Another take-home point, according to Dr. Schweizer, is that all women in this study noted pain, and women with severe dysmenorrhea noted significantly more pain. In his clinical experience, Dr. Schweizer said, IUD placement is usually described by women as \"crampy, painful,\" and generally unpleasant. Patient counseling remains important and should include information about discomfort during the pelvic exam, pain associated with IUD insertion, and the benefits and risks of IUD use. Benefits, according to Dr. Schweizer, include insertion of a reliable, reversible form of contraception that is \"nonnegotiable.\" Risks include infection, bleeding, and rarely, uterine perforation. \"Physicians routinely suggest Motrin or Tylenol prior to IUD insertion,\" Dr. Schweizer stated. \"Women need to understand that IUD insertion is associated with short-lived pain.\" Dr. Suhonen reports receiving lecture fess from Bayer and MSD Finland and being on the advisory board for Contraception MSD Finland. One coauthor reported occasionally serving on the advisory board and designing educational events for Bayer Healthcare, Gedeon Richter, and MSD/Merck.

				"body": "(Reuters Health) - Young pre-teens are likely to misuse over-the-counter medicines if they're not educated about proper use and the dangers of abuse, experts warn in a new campaign encouraging parents to talk with their children about household drugs. Research suggests so-called tweens begin to self-administer over-the-counter (OTC) medicines during the fifth or sixth grade, experts say. In 2012, U.S. poison centers managed nearly 300,000 exposure cases in children aged six to 19; more than half these cases involved medication errors and misuse. Each year, some 10,000 emergency center visits involving individuals younger than 18 are caused by adolescents self-administering OTC medicines, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). OTC Literacy, a project from the AAPCC and Scholastic Corporation, with support from McNeil Consumer Healthcare, commissioned two surveys to better understand the level of medicine safety awareness among U.S. youth and their parents. OTC Literacy provides resources and educational materials specially designed to help parents and teachers teach tweens - that is, kids ages 10 to 12 - about medicine safety and the dangers of abuse (). The survey of 1,100 tweens found that only about half of them knew OTC medicines could be dangerous if misused. Asked about the differences between prescription and OTC medicines, only 56% of them answered questions correctly. When tested on how to read a drug facts label correctly, tweens only answered 53% of questions correctly. And a survey of 600 parents found they often overestimated their kids' knowledge of OTC medicine, such as the risks associated with not taking medicines as directed or combining multiple drugs at once. Most parents believed their children knew who to ask if they had questions concerning OTC medicines. \"This is a really serious issue that may have life-threatening results for kids and tweens. I see this in my office every day,\" Dr. Tanya Altmann, a pediatrician in Westlake Village, California, told Reuters Health. \"In many cases, medications are left on counters for convenience or when somebody is sick, and tweens think they can take it if they have a headache or something.\" Altmann recommends that parents teach their children about active ingredients and store medications and cough syrups out of reach. Nicole Vesely, Safe Kids Coordinator with University of Wisconsin-Madison's American Family Children's Hospital, said she believes some accidental overdoses could be avoided if parents teach their children to always use the dosing device that comes with most cough syrups and liquid medicines. \"Parents don't always use the dosing device that comes with medicine, so if they use a different measuring device, like a teaspoon, it can lead to accidental overdose,\" she told Reuters Health. \"I think many parents have a mindset that prescription drugs are much more dangerous than over-the-counter drugs, because they can be purchased whenever they want. But they have a lot of the same dangers.\" Michael S. Wolf, a professor of medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said he believes many teens and some adults are confused by the small writing and packaging on most OTC drugs. He said the new surveys are not surprising, but will serve as a reminder of the need for more education about personal health for teens. \"Do they understand the difference between Advil and Tylenol? Do they know how to navigate a drug box? We haven't found a place or time to talk to tweens about these things, and we're confined to very small packaging with very small fonts,\" he told Reuters Health. \"It's a very interesting age to be focusing on, the tweens, because this is a population that is transitioning to accept more responsibilities and take control over their own health.\" ",

				"body": "DUNDEE, SCOTLAND — Effervescent or readily soluble formats of common medications, such as painkillers and vitamin supplements, contain high levels of \"hidden\" sodium, which was linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, researchers report [1] . In an observational study of UK adults followed for about seven years, being prescribed a readily soluble formulation as opposed to a regular formulation of a drug was associated with a 22% increased risk of stroke and a sevenfold increased risk of hypertension. Sodium carbonate or bicarbonate in effervescent, dispersible, and soluble medications and vitamins makes them release carbon dioxide in water, so that they are more readily absorbed, lead author Dr Jacob George (University of Dundee, Scotland) explained to heart wire in an email. These formats may be prescribed to patients who have difficulty swallowing or need a drug with a rapid onset of action (such as for migraine). However, according to the authors, the study suggests that \"sodium-containing formulations should be prescribed with caution only if the perceived benefits outweigh [the] risks . . . and patients . . . should be carefully monitored for the emergence of hypertension.\" The study also showed that \"the public should be warned about the potential hazards of high sodium consumption in prescribed medicine, and these should be clearly labeled with the sodium content in the same way as foods are labeled.\" The findings can likely be extrapolated to include over-the-counter formulations, which were not studied, they add. The study was published November 26, 2013 in BMJ. Surprising Source of Sodium: Fizzy Pills and Vitamins The negative impact on health from consuming too much dietary sodium is a worldwide concern. However, \"curiously, unlike foods, pharmaceutical manufacturers are not placed under any restrictions or obligations with regards to sodium content or labeling of these sodium-containing formulations,\" write George and colleagues. The authors hypothesized that taking medication formulations that contain sodium might lead to increased cardiovascular events. They performed a nested case-control study of patients aged 18 and older who were part of the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database and received at least two prescriptions for any of 24 sodium-containing formulations of drugs or vitamin or mineral supplements or 116 standard formulations of those products from 1987 to 2010. Sodium-containing medications included acetaminophen (paracetemol, Tylenol), effervescent aspirin, and soluble ibuprofen for pain; calcium carbonate (Alka-Seltzer) for acid indigestion; and metoclopramide plus aspirin for migraine. Vitamin and mineral supplements included ascorbic acid and zinc sulfate. Of more than 1.29 million patients, 61 072 had an incident cardiovascular event and were matched with controls. After adjustment for multiple variables, patients who took sodium-containing formulations had a 1.16-fold increased odds of the primary outcome (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death) compared with controls. Risk of outcome, sodium-containing vs standard formulations group Outcome Adjusted a odds ratio (95% CI) Composite outcome b 1.16 (1.12–1.21) Incident nonfatal stroke 1.22 (1.16–1.29) Hypertension 7.18 (6.74–7.65) All-cause mortality 1.28 (1.23–1.33) a. Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, chronic illness, and use of other medications. b. Nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, vascular death. George explained that the average consumption of sodium from the preparations was 106.7 mmol/day, which is higher than the recommended UK dietary intake (104 mmol/day) or US dietary intake (approximately 100 mmol/day). For example, a 500-mg tablet of soluble acetaminophen contains 18.6 mmol of sodium, and the maximum daily dosage contains 148.8 mmol of sodium. \"We would like to see more discussion between regulators—like the [US Food and Drug Administration ] and [UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ]—and industry on the sodium content of medications, and hopefully newer innovations that might enable a reduction in the sodium content of these preparations,\" he concluded. The study was funded by Tenovus Scotland. The authors had no conflicts of interest. ",

				"body": "June 20, 2011 — Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceutical, manufacturers of the antipsychotic Risperdal (risperidone), has voluntarily recalled 16,000 bottles of the brand name drug and 24,000 bottles of its generic counterpart because of an unusual odor. The offensive smell is thought to be caused by trace amounts of a chemical called TBA (2,4,6-tribromoanisole), which is used to preserve wood often used in the construction of pallets on which materials are transported and stored. \"While not considered to be toxic, TBA can generate an offensive odor and a very small number of patients have reported temporary gastrointestinal symptoms when taking other products with this odor. As it relate to Risperdal and risperidone, there have been no reported serious adverse events caused by the presence of TBA,\" said a statement released by the company. This recall is the latest in a string of other, similar, recalls that have included topiramate and Tylenol . The Risperdal lot was shipped between August 27, 2010, and February 15, 2011. The company believes there are approximately 1600 bottles of Risperdal from this lot remaining in the marketplace. The risperidone lot was shipped between November 10, 2010, and January 1, 2011. The company believes there are fewer than 1200 bottles of risperidone from this lot remaining in the marketplace. The recalls have been initiated in the United States and Puerto Rico at the wholesale and retail (pharmacy) level. More information about the recall is available on the FDA Web site . Adverse events or quality concerns related to these products should be reported to MedWatch by telephone at 1-800-332-1088, by fax at 1-800-332-1078, online at , or by mail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

				"body": "The CDC is looking for a few good nurses and doctors -- but especially nurses -- to help fight the Ebola epidemic. In response to the critical needs for more health care workers in West Africa, the agency plans to launch a 3-day training course to teach qualified professionals to safely treat people with Ebola. It will be held at the FEMA-run Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, AL. Classes will begin Oct. 6. The training is expected to be an important part of President Barack Obama’s plan to step up the U.S. response to the crisis in West Africa. Obama is due to announce more details of the plan from the CDC’s Atlanta campus on Tuesday, according to the White House. On Friday, Margaret Chan, MD, director-general of the World Health Organization, said the Ebola-affected countries are running short on almost everything. “But the thing we need most of all is people, health care workers,” Chan said. “The right people. The right specialists. And specialists who are appropriately trained, and know how to keep themselves safe.” Cuba -- a country famed for its medical training programs -- offered 165 doctors, nurses, and infection control specialists who will travel to Sierra Leone, a country that lost a fourth doctor to the deadly virus over the weekend.The Ebola outbreak has taken a heavy toll on health care workers in countries where health care had already been gutted by years of poverty and civil war. More than 300 health workers have become infected and nearly half have died, according to the WHO. Training Course Details The course offered by the CDC is modeled on the training provided by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders. Among other things, instructors will teach participants to safely put on and take off the full-body personal protective equipment that doctors must wear around highly infectious patients. It will also teach the buddy system that MSF uses to help keep its doctors safe. Partners are taught to watch each other as they don the gear to make sure no steps are missed. “This is an unprecedented event that’s occurring,” says John Brooks, MD. He's an infectious disease specialist with the CDC who is in charge of the program. “The call for people who can provide medical care to the hundreds of patients who have Ebola virus disease, it’s a big call. The first step in getting people to go care for these people is to provide them with the proper training to make sure they themselves don’t get infected and can provide that care safely.” Brooks says the greatest need is for mid-level care providers like nurses and physician assistants. “There may be a misperception that the kind of care that people need for Ebola virus disease is intensive-level ICU care. That’s the ideal,” Brooks says. “But that’s simply not available in these countries.” He says the main care provided to people with Ebola is giving them medications by mouth like acetaminophen (Tylenol) to bring down a fever, giving injections, and starting IV lines. People who have those skills also need to have an invitation from a volunteer organization to work in the affected countries before they can take the course. They should also have some experience working in resource-poor settings, and will have to pay their way to and from the training center. Hurdles in the Way It’s not clear whether the program will have many takers. When the course was first advertised on ProMED-mail, a listserv for infectious disease experts, the response was polite, but tepid, says Larry Madoff, MD. He's the editor of the forum, which is affiliated with the International Society for Infectious Disease. “Most of us just can’t go,” Madoff says. “Many of us feel it would be great to be available to help. We do it in ways that we can.” But he says many doctors feel that leaving for weeks or months would mean abandoning their own patients here at home. Others are in contractual agreements with hospitals that don’t allow for time off. “Most people have home and family and job responsibilities that prevent them from just picking up and moving to West Africa. Even if you didn’t add the element of danger and difficulty, it’s very hard for people to leave on short notice and do something like this. I’m not surprised that a lot of people can’t do it,” he says. Something else that’s likely to stop people is the expense, says Dan Lucey, MD. He's an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., who has recently treated people with Ebola in West Africa. “In my view, one thing that could readily be removed as an obstacle altogether is paying your own way. Really, why would volunteers who are going to go and put their lives in harm’s way to help with the Ebola effort, why should they have to pay their own plane fare?” Even with some hurdles to overcome, Brooks is hopeful that people will be interested in volunteering. He says getting more boots on the ground is critical to stopping the outbreak. “This effort of training people and generally raising the level of infection control and awareness within this region is a first step in restoring trust in the health care system,” he says. “Scared people who are fearful that health care centers are where you get Ebola are not going in for care. We need to restore that trust.” For More Information Learn more about the course Criteria for admission to the course Sample course syllabus SOURCES: John Brooks, MD, leader, HIV epidemiology research team, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta.

				"body": "BOSTON, Massachusetts — The link between acetaminophen ( Tylenol and generics) and liver damage is well established, but there is also evidence to suggest that in some asymptomatic patients, therapeutic doses of acetaminophen and light-to-moderate alcohol use can lead to renal disease. An examination of data from a nationwide health survey found that taken alone, neither light-to-moderate alcohol consumption nor acetaminophen were associated with significant risk for kidney disease. But respondents who reported taking both acetaminophen and drinking lightly or moderately had a more than two-fold higher risk for kidney dysfunction. \"Although individually it may not be harmful to ingest therapeutic doses of acetaminophen and light to moderate amounts of alcohol, we found that combining the two has the potential to be hazardous,\" said Harrison Ndetan, MSc, MPH, DrPH, from Parker University in Dallas, Texas, at the American Public Health Association 141st annual meeting here. The findings suggest that primary care practitioners who treat patients with acute and chronic pain should inform them of the potential for kidney problems with concomitant use of alcohol and over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics containing acetaminophen, he told Medscape Medical News. Pain is among the most common symptoms seen in primary practice, and an estimated 36 million Americans self-medicate with OTC analgesics, of which acetaminophen-containing products are the most frequently used, Dr, Ndetan said. Acetaminophen has been shown to have nephrotoxic effects when used above recommended doses, and alcohol is known to affect renal filtration protein transporters that can affect acetaminophen metabolism, he said. Alcohol and Analgesics To see whether alcohol might exacerbate the renal effects of the drug when both are used in moderation, Dr. Ndetan and colleagues examined data from the 2003-2004 iteration of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Among more than 10,000 respondents included in the analysis, 38.13% reported mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption, 5.6% reported using therapeutic doses of acetaminophen, and 2.6% reported using both. In all, 1.2% of respondents reported renal dysfunction. In logistic regression analyses controlling for sociodemographics and health conditions, the authors found that the combination but not acetaminophen or alcohol alone was associated with significant risk for kidney dysfunction (see table). Table. Risk for Renal Dysfunction, NHANES 2003 - 2004 Variable Odds Ratio 95% Confidence Interval Therapeutic acetaminophen (1.2 g) 0.91 0.57 - 1.45 Light/moderate alcohol 0.53 0.43 - 0.65 Acetaminophen and alcohol 2.23 1.22 - 4.08   The risk for kidney dysfunction in respondents who mixed acetaminophen and alcohol was greater for older adults, males, blacks, and Hispanics (vs, whites), and those with conditions that may compromise renal function, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Jeanmarie Perrone, MD, associate professor of emergency medicine and director of medical toxicology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia told Medscape Medical News that acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicty typically manifests as renal insufficiency in about 1% - 2% of patients who present with acetaminophen overdose. Although it is not as well documented as acetaminophen hepatoxicity, it is not all that uncommon. Dr. Perrone is coauthor of a study of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity. She notes that chronic alcohol use as well as certain drugs (eg, anticonvulsants) are associated with increased activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP-450) pathway, and that CYP-450 can enhance acetaminophen toxicity ( J Med Toxicol. 2008; Mar 4(1):2-6 ). The study funding source was not reported. Dr. Ndetan and Dr. Perrone have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

				"body": "By Jessica Dye NEW YORK (Reuters) Jul 18 - Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $22.9 million to end a lawsuit from investors who claimed the company concealed quality-control failures that culminated in a broad recall of children's medicines, according to court filings. The proposed settlement was filed Monday in a U.S. federal court in New Jersey, and must be approved by the judge overseeing the case. Johnson & Johnson did not admit any liability or wrongdoing in the settlement, court filings said. \"We maintain that the claims in this action are without merit, and settled this case in order to avoid the expense, distraction and time associated with continuing litigation,\" Johnson & Johnson spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in a statement. Johnson & Johnson took more than 40 nonprescription products off store shelves in 2010, including Children's Tylenol, in what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has characterized as the largest recall of children's medicine in the agency's history. The recalls came after FDA inspectors found multiple problems at the company's Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, plant, including bacterial contamination of ingredients and filthy equipment. The facility was later shut down. Shareholders filed a proposed class action against the company several months later, saying Johnson & Johnson cut back on quality-control measures prior to the recalls, and took steps to conceal that from investors and the public. Once the extent of the recalls came to light, share prices fell, investors said. The company was also accused of trying to avoid publicity by concealing facts about the recalls, including the orchestration of a \"phantom recall\" of Motrin products, in which third-party contractors covertly removed suspect containers from stores. The proposed settlement \"provides a substantial benefit to the class and is a favorable result,\" plaintiffs said in the court filing. ",

				"body": "May 18, 2011 — An FDA advisory panel says that pediatric doses of acetaminophen should be based first on a child's weight, then on age. The panel noted that infant acetaminophen -- Tylenol is the best-known brand -- should be labeled only for fever reduction in children under age 2. Labels may recommend acetaminophen for both fever and pain in children over age 2. The panel found too little evidence to label over-the-counter acetaminophen for pain relief in infants under age 2, although doctors often prescribe the drug for this punsumer Healthcare Products Arpose. The recommendation not to include pain as an indication for acetaminophen in kids under age 2 is the only part of the panel's advice to which the over-the-counter drug industry trade group objects. Otherwise, the Cossociation (CHPA) applauds the panel's advice. In addition to weight-based dosing and the infant fever recommendation, the panel also advised the FDA to: Require that bottles of infant acetaminophen carry dosing instructions for children ages 6 months to 2 years. Although this information is often requested by parents, current labels warn parents of the danger of fever in kids under age 2 years and tell them to call a doctor. Require acetaminophen makers to change the bottles of liquid acetaminophen to make it harder for kids to take an accidental overdose. Require liquid acetaminophen bottles to come with a measuring device clearly marked in milliliters using the standard \"mL\" abbreviation. Require all solid, pill forms of acetaminophen for children to come in the same concentration. Previous panels already recommended this for liquid formulations of acetaminophen. The FDA usually, but not always, follows the advice of its advisory panels. Beating the FDA panel to the punch, the CHPA recently announced that acetaminophen makers would voluntarily convert all single-ingredient liquid acetaminophen products to a single concentration, doing away with the more concentrated infant drops that reduce the amount of liquid an infant has to swallow. The industry also announced it would put flow restrictors on liquid acetaminophen bottles to make it hard for kids to drink large amounts of the drug in an accidental, unsupervised ingestion. Moreover, the companies will provide clearly marked syringes with all products for kids ages 3 and younger, and will add clearly marked dosing cups to all products for kids ages 2 to 12. Acetaminophen Overdose: Common Reasons In providing information to the panel, the FDA found that only a fraction of fatal and non-fatal acetaminophen overdoses in children are reported to the federal agency. However, it listed common reasons for acetaminophen overdoses in children: Inadequate prominence of the concentration on the container label. Providers not specifying what formulation parents should use. Providers not aware of varying concentrations available in the market. The use of adult formulations of acetaminophen in children. Confusion regarding how to measure with dosing devices. Use of devices not packaged with the medication. Dangerous abbreviations used on dosing devices. Misinterpretation or misunderstanding of provider instructions. Misinterpretation of labels, labeling, and dosage charts. Not following labeled directions or simply guessing how to dose. Miscalculation when trying to convert measuring units (e.g. mL to teaspoons). Miscalculation of doses. Inconsistency of dosing based on weight vs. dosing based on age. Administration of acetaminophen by multiple parents or caregivers. Parents were not aware that other products contained acetaminophen. Caregivers who were not aware that acetaminophen and Tylenol have the same active ingredient. Avoiding Acetaminophen Overdose To avoid these errors -- as well as accidental overdoses by children themselves -- the CHPA offers this advice: Always read and follow the label. Only use the medicine that treats your child’s specific symptoms. Store ALL of your family’s medicines, including products you use every day, high up and out of sight from children. Put medicines away -- out of reach and out of sight -- EVERY time you use them. Always lock the child safety cap completely every time you use a medicine. Always tell children what medicines are, and do not refer to them as candy. Remind house guests not to put medicines in purses, bags, coats, or other places small children can get into.

				"body": "By Will Boggs, MD NEW YORK (Reuters Health) Aug 06 - Ibuprofen, whether given prophylactically or therapeutically, did not provide optimal pain control during first-trimester medical abortion in a recent randomized trial. \"Our study did not show that either approach lacked effectiveness - that is, both might have been better than nothing,\" Dr. Elizabeth G. Raymond from Gynuity Health Projects and Planned Parenthood of New York City told Reuters Health. \"What we showed is that neither approach appears to be superior to the other, and neither works as well as we'd have liked.\" \"We were disappointed, of course,\" Dr. Raymond said. \"Pain is a substantial problem for women having medical abortion, and we would have liked to find a regimen that works better than either of these did in reducing pain.\" Oral analgesics given with or shortly before misoprostol have not been shown to reduce the pain of medical abortion. In this trial, Dr. Raymond and colleagues compared two ibuprofen regimens to control pain in first-trimester abortion with 200 mg mifepristone followed by misoprostol. One hundred eleven women took the first dose of ibuprofen one hour before the misoprostol and continued taking it for two days regardless of pain (the prophylactic group). The other 117 women took ibuprofen as needed after the onset of pain. Maximum pain scores did not differ significantly between the prophylactic group (mean, 7.1/10) and the treatment group (mean, 7.3/10), according to a report that will appear online in the September issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The two groups did not differ in any other measures of pain severity, duration, or acceptability. Younger age, greater than usual menstrual cramps severity, and higher expected pain from the upcoming abortion were the only baseline characteristics independently associated with higher maximum pain scores. There were no serious adverse events during the study. Significantly fewer women in the prophylactic group than in the treatment group reported nausea or vomiting or dizziness, but the incidence of other expected ibuprofen side effects did not differ between the groups. \"Currently, medical abortion providers use a variety of different analgesic approaches,\" Dr. Raymond said. \"At this point, we have no guidance on any that are much better than others, and none of them seem to work as well as we'd like.\" \"One study has found that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is inferior to ibuprofen in controlling pain, so I'd suggest that acetaminophen not be the first choice,\" Dr. Raymond said. \"Practitioners should advocate for more research in this area!\" SOURCE: Obstet Gynecol 2013;122:558-564.

				"body": "By Kathryn Doyle NEW YORK (Reuters Health) Nov 22 - Frequent use of acetaminophen in pregnancy may be linked to poorer language skills and behavior problems in offspring, according to a new study. As the most popular over-the-counter drug in the U.S., acetaminophen has been extensively studied in relation to premature birth and miscarriage, with no connections found. But its maker Johnson & Johnson periodically comes under fire for the drug's small therapeutic index. So interest in investigating the drug persists. The new study is the first to look at young children whose mothers took acetaminophen while pregnant. \"Our findings suggest that (acetaminophen) might not be as harmless as we think,\" Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen said. She led the study at the School of Pharmacy at the University of Oslo in Norway. She and her coauthors studied 48,000 Norwegian children whose mothers answered survey questions about their medication use at weeks 17 and 30 of pregnancy, and again six months after giving birth. Mothers filled out a follow-up questionnaire about their child's developmental milestones three years later. Close to 4% of women took acetaminophen for at least 28 days total during pregnancy. Their children seemed to have poorer motor skills than kids whose mothers had taken the drug fewer times or not at all. Acetaminophen-exposed kids also tended to start walking later, have poorer communication and language skills and more behavior problems. It's difficult to define risks for pregnant women and their children, since rigorous tests and controlled studies of drug exposure aren't ethical, Brandlistuen said. All researchers can do is closely observe women in the real world. But this study, published online October 24 in the International Journal of Epidemiology, involved a large number of women, and researchers also looked for any link to ibuprofen. They found no development problems tied to ibuprofen. \"Long-term use of (acetaminophen) increased the risk of behavior problems by 70% at age three,\" Brandlistuen said. \"That is considerable.\" Heavy users most often reported taking the drug for five to seven days in a row a few times during pregnancy, she said. \"Sixty-five percent of women will take this drug at some point during pregnancy,\" said Ann Z. Bauer, a doctoral candidate at the School of Health and Environment at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Bauer was not involved in the new research but has studied acetaminophen and autism risk. \"Some people just pop Tylenol when they have a headache,\" said Dr. Martha Herbert, an autism researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The developmental problems seen in this study align with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, though the children had not been diagnosed at age three. Herbert has been studying the possible link between acetaminophen and the disorder for several years. \"I don't think it's a done deal,\" she told Reuters Health. She doesn't like to pin \"the cause of autism\" on any one thing, as many factors are likely involved. \"But for those people who wish to take precautions, this is something they can do,\" Herbert said, referring to pregnant women cutting down on acetaminophen use or choosing ibuprofen instead. In a statement to Reuters Health, Jodie Wertheim a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson, said the drug \"has an exceptional safety profile. As the authors note in the study, there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\" Wertheim continued, \"We always recommend that consumers carefully read and follow label instructions when using any over the counter medication. In addition, our label notes if pregnant or breast-feeding, ask a health professional before use. Consumers who have medical concerns or questions about acetaminophen should contact their health care professional.\" The developmental effects Brandlistuen's team noted at age three could manifest differently or disappear with age, but only future studies can answer that question, she said. \"Since this is the only study to show this, there is a need for further research to confirm or refute these results before too many implications are made,\" she said.

				"body": "Abstract and Introduction Abstract and Introduction Abstract The purpose of this descriptive secondary analysis was to explore the use of Communication Accommodation Theory as a framework to examine pain communication strategies used by older adults and their primary care practitioners during medical ambulatory care visits. Ambulatory medical visits for 22 older adults with moderate or greater osteoarthritis pain were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and coded by two independent raters for six a priori communication strategies derived from the attuning strategies of Communication Accommodation Theory: 1) patient selecting the pain topic; 2) patient taking a turn; 3) patient maintaining focus on the pain topic; 4) practitioner using an open-ended question without social desirability to start the pain discussion; 5) practitioner encouraging the patient to take a turn by asking open-ended questions; and 6) practitioner interruptions. The majority of practitioners did not start the pain discussion with an open-ended question, but did not interrupt the older adults as they discussed their pain. Five (22.7%) of the older adults did not discuss their osteoarthritis pain during the ambulatory medical visit. The majority of patients took their turn during the pain discussion, but did not maintain focus while describing important osteoarthritis pain information to their practitioner. Practitioners might assist older adults to communicate more information about their pain by initiating the pain discussion with an open-ended pain question. Older adults might provide more pain information to their practitioner by staying on the pain topic until they have completed all of the pain information they wish to discuss with the practitioner. Introduction Practitioner-patient communication is the basis for information exchange during ambulatory medical visits and is the vehicle through which therapeutic relationships are formed. If communication is done poorly, then patients may not fully disclose their symptoms and issues and opportunities are lost (Frantsve & Kerns, 2007). The present study explored the use of Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) as a basis for understanding the communication between practitioners and older adults with osteoarthritis pain during routine ambulatory medical visits. Practitioner communication with older adults is a process that may have layers of preconceived notions on both sides of the communication that can affect the amount and quality of information exchanged. It is also possible that attitudes and expectations of elderly patients and practitioners regarding health care choices are affected by the age of the patient (Frantsve & Kerns, 2007). Practitioner-Patient Communication Practitioner-Patient Communication The importance of recognizing patients as the experts about their own health and reality is central to the reason that practitioner-patient communication needs to be understood and optimized. Roter and Hall's (2006) communication-transforming principles stress that practitioners and patients shape their relationship, influencing each other, and through the nature of their relationship, process and outcomes of care are defined. Although Roter and Hall (2006) developed a helpful method that examines how practitioners communicate with patients, their work does not adequately capture the patient's perspective. CAT offers insights into both sides of any communication, and it is through the examination of CAT that some understanding can be gained of the way medical visits are conducted and how older adults with chronic osteoarthritis pain communicate with their practitioners. There has been much work done on the optimum way to treat osteoarthritis and other persistent pain, yet research has shown that many older adults are not properly prescribed treatments and medications to help decrease their pain (Ausiello & Stafford, 2002; Porcheret, Jordan, Jinks, & Croft, 2007; Won, Lapane, Vallow, Schein, Morris, & Lipsitz, 2004). Communication Accommodation Theory Communication Accommodation Theory CAT is a theory that describes the psychologic, social, and linguistic behaviors that people exhibit when communicating with each other (Coupland, Coupland, Giles, & Henwood, 1988). In this theory, each person has his or her own personality, life experiences, and motivation when approaching a communication encounter, and these factors manifest in how they talk, listen, and respond to the other person. According to this theory, communication between two people can at any time be adjusted by either party in response to actual, perceived, or stereotyped expectations of the other person (Coupland et al., 1988). As a theory that combines elements of psychology, sociology, and linguistics, CAT offers insights into how humans interact when communicating. This theory has potential in examining the patient-practitioner dyad to understand how ambulatory medical visit conversations function and where communication interventions may be useful to improve patient outcomes. One premise of CAT is that a defining characteristic of social groups is a common set of social and language behaviors. When members from different groups try to communicate they must find a way to adjust (attune) to each other's different communication styles and abilities (Coupland et al., 1988). According to Coupland et al. (1988), the strategies that people use to adjust their communication include approximation, interpretability, interpersonal control, and discourse management. Approximation strategies are the ways that the speaker adjusts his or her style in response to the other person and can manifest in changes in rate of speech, accents, pauses, or nonverbal behaviors. For example, a practitioner may choose to slow down her rate of speech if she believes that the patient may not be following the content of her discussion. Approximation can occur in positive or negative ways allowing the speaker to choose if she wants the listener to understand and be at ease or if she wants to accentuate their differences (Jones, Gallois, Callan, & Barker, 1999). Interpretability refers to the speaker paying attention to the listener's real or perceived ability to understand the words that are chosen and is often witnessed in medical settings when practitioners choose how much medical jargon they will use and how often they will explain concepts in easy-to-understand terminology (Jones et al., 1999). Interpersonal control strategies refer to how people perceive their role and the role of the other and to how they do or do not exert their power in communication exchanges (Jones et al., 1999). For example, a practitioner who feels that her role is to be an authority figure may use the behavior of interrupting the patient as a way to exert control over the flow and length of conversation during an ambulatory medical visit. A patient's use of interpersonal control strategies might be in controlling the flow of information on a particular topic by remaining focused despite practitioner attempts to move on to another topic. Discourse management strategies are the ways in which a conversation can be managed by taking the lead or sharing topic selection, allowing or prohibiting equal turn taking, and elements of the roles that people assume during communication. For example, practitioners may choose to lead the conversation during a medical visit by using primarily closed-ended questions that limit the choice of responses for the patient. Patients may respond by either going along with the yes-no answers or they may interject and change the topic to one of their choosing. Examples of the roles that might be played out in a medical visit are viewing the practitioner as a paternalistic authority versus a partner in patient care, and the older adult as a self-advocating independent person versus a dependent and frail patient. The two strategies focused on for the present study, interpersonal control and discourse management, are psychologic elements of communication that are evident in the flow of communication between practitioners and patients and are more readily examined in written transcripts than the other two strategies. Practitioner communication content and styles similar to CAT approximation and interpretability strategies have been previously examined (Roter, Hall, Kern, Barker, Cole, & Roca, 1995; Roter, Stewart, Putnam, Lipkin, Stiles, & Inui, 1997), but not simultaneously with the patient's role in the communication encounters. Another way that CAT may help to describe the pain communication between an older adult and his or her practitioner during a medical visit is the element of the theory that describes how people may consciously or subconsciously choose communication behaviors (Coupland et al., 1988). Additionally, these behaviors may be based on preconceived bias (or implicit stereotyping) and may be in relation to what the speaker perceives that the listener will be able to understand instead of waiting for or soliciting feedback from the listener (Coupland et al., 1988, Hummert, 1999). For example, if a practitioner believes that older adults are typically hard of hearing and are naïve of medical terminology they may alter their volume and choice of words to attempt to accommodate the older adult listener. Although this approach might be helpful and well received by some older adults, others may find this speech pattern insulting. The older adult may also alter her own speech behaviors to decrease the risk of seeming too demanding in an attempt to please the practitioner whom they may see as an authority figure (Greene & Adelman, 2001). These preconceived ideas and biases are fraught with danger in a medical visit setting, because they may get in the way of therapeutic relationships and prevent the exchange of important information from both the practitioner and the patient. Objective Objective The purpose of this study was to explore the CAT strategies used by older adults and their practitioners as they discussed persistent pain issues during ambulatory medical visits. Methods Methods Design The design was a descriptive secondary analysis of patient and practitioner discussions during ambulatory medical visits. The parent study was a randomized controlled pilot study that examined the effects of a virtual pain coach intervention on subsequent elderly patient discussions of pain information (McDonald, Walsh, Vergara, & Gifford, in review). Sample The sample consisted of transcripts from 22 community-dwelling older adult medical ambulatory medical visits. All of the older adults were aged ≥60 years, had osteoarthritis, spoke and understood English, and had self-identified their pain level at ≥4 on a 0–10 pain intensity scale within the last month. Older adults with rheumatoid arthritis, pain from cancer, or who planned a total joint replacement within 1 month of the time of study participation were excluded. Procedure Institutional Review Board approval was secured for the parent study and the present study. A brief description of the parent study, a randomized controlled clinical pilot study, provides context for the current study. Immediately before a scheduled ambulatory medical visit, older adults were randomly assigned to watch a videotape teaching them important osteoarthritis pain information to discuss with their practitioner and then to practice talking with a virtual pain coach, or to watch only the videotape. The ambulatory medical visits were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data reported in the present study included one practice setting and visits with five practitioners. The five practitioners that participated were all physicians. The a priori pain content criteria used in the parent study analysis were from the American Pain Society (2002) pain guidelines and had been used in previous studies (McDonald, Gifford, & Walsh, 2013; McDonald, Shea, Rose, & Fedo, 2009). The previously coded transcripts were used in the present study to focus the secondary analysis only on sections of the conversation where clinically significant pain information was exchanged. Krippendorff's (2004) content analysis methodology was used for the coding and analysis of data. Krippendorff defined content analysis as \"a research technique for making replicable and valid inferences from texts … to the contexts of their use\" (p. 18). Using this methodology, it was hoped to infer that specific elements of CAT were occurring in the conversations between practitioner and patient during pain content discussions. The steps in Krippendorff's method are unitizing, sampling, recording, reducing, inferring, and narrating. Focus was maintained on only the segments of the ambulatory medical visit in which pain content was discussed. The units to be analyzed were any word or phrase that described a component of one of the six a priori CAT attuning strategies (communication strategies) identified for analysis that occurred during discussion of the previously coded pain information content. A priori communication strategy criteria included patient selecting the pain topic (patient select), patient taking a turn (patient turn), patient maintaining focus on the pain topic (patient focus), practitioner using an open-ended question without social desirability to start the pain discussion (practitioner open-ended start), practitioner encouraging the patient to take a turn by asking open-ended questions without social desirability (practitioner open-ended encourage), and practitioner interrupting the patient during pain content discussion (practitioner interruption). Social desirability is a type of bias that causes people to respond in a more socially acceptable way, rather than to respond accurately. For example when greeting someone and saying \"How are you?\" one expects the answer to be \"Fine.\" Table 1 contains definitions and scoring of criteria for patients, and Table 2 contains definitions and scoring of criteria for practitioners. Transcripts were examined by two trained independent raters. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and recorded to calculate reliability scores. Data for patient focus and practitioner open-ended start were coded as present (1) or absent (0). To confirm the presence or absence of practitioner interruption, the tapes were reviewed and data audibly collected. Data for the remaining items (patient select, patient turn, and practitioner open-ended encourage) were each summed for a total number present in each ambulatory medical visit. Length of ambulatory medical visit was timed as the tapes were listened to and included only the amount of time when the practitioner and patient were in the room together to accurately record the total patient-practitioner communication during the ambulatory medical visit. The final steps in Krippendorff's (2004) technique are reducing, inferring, and narrating. In the present study, results from coding were summed for each transcript and entered into SPSS statistical software. Analysis Frequencies, means, and standard deviations were conducted to describe older adult characteristics for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, and education. The parent study consisted of two experimental conditions: A) a pain communication education plus coaching intervention to help older adults practice discussing their pain; and B) a pain communication education video only. The participant's group membership (A or B) and the content analysis items were statistically examined to look for large differences using cross-tabulation analysis with the chi-square statistic on the items patient maintaining focus and practitioner open-ended start, even though small group differences would not be detectable in our small sample. These tests revealed no significant differences between the two groups of participants. The remaining content analysis items and length of ambulatory medical visit were examined between the two groups (A or B) using independent t tests and were also found to have no large differences based on group membership. For the sake of the descriptive analysis, the groups were therefore combined for the content analysis. Interrater reliability was calculated using percentage of agreement and the more conservative Krippendorff alpha. Results from the CAT strategy content analysis were summarized with frequencies. Results Results The majority of the older adults were college educated (59.1%), white (86.4%), and female (81.8%); the overall mean age was 74.7 (SD 7.55) years. Older adults reported a pain intensity at the time of the ambulatory medical visit with a mean of 3.6 (SD 1.55) on a 0–10 pain scale. Ambulatory medical visit length ranged from 7 to 30 minutes with a mean of 14.3 (SD 5.97) minutes. Interrater reliability across all coding resulted in a Krippendorff alpha of 0.82 and 90.8% agreement. No pain discussion occurred in five ambulatory medical visits (22.7%). For the 17 practitioner-patient encounters that included pain discussions, patients initiated pain discussion by selecting the topic a range of zero to three times per ambulatory medical visit with a mean of 0.9 (SD 1.03). An example of a patient initializing the pain discussion (patient select) occurred at the beginning of one ambulatory medical visit when the patient opened with, \"Actually I am here for a gynecological exam. I hope you have time for both of them. Yeah, I've been having an awful lot of arthritis pain lately.\" Patients took their turn (patient turn) in the pain discussion one to twelve times per ambulatory medical visit with a mean of 6.8 (SD 3.13), as shown in the following exchange where this section of transcript was scored two points for each turn the patient took: Practitioner: Do you take a Tylenol or Aleve at night? Patient: I take Tylenol at night and sometimes I'll take the Aleve. Practitioner: And that doesn't get you through? Patient: Not really. Not the Tylenol. The Aleve will get me closer. Patients did not maintain focus on the pain topic in ten ambulatory medical visits (58.8%). Patient loss of focus was evident in the transcripts when patients changed to a new topic but later returned to the pain discussion and revealed more information. For example, one patient began to discuss a needed change in pain medications (Celebrex) owing to stomach issues and then went off topic by asking details about a diagnostic test that a different doctor had ordered. Eventually the practitioner brought the discussion back to the needed change in medications and the patient discussed the remainder of the osteoarthritis pain content in the ambulatory medical visit. Out of the 17 ambulatory medical visits with pain discussions, practitioners opened the pain discussion seven times (41.2%) with an open-ended question without social desirability (practitioner open-ended start.) One practitioner exemplified this category by asking, \"Any particular problems that you've been having since I saw you last time?\" Throughout their encounters, practitioners used open-ended questions without social desirability to encourage patient turn taking (practitioner open-ended encourage) with a mean of 1.4 (SD 1.28) per ambulatory medical visit. One practitioner encouraged further input from the patient by asking, \"Any other pains today that you have?\" In the 17 medical visits with pain discussions, practitioners interrupted patients two times (11.8%). In the taped conversations, interruptions were heard when the practitioner spoke while the patient was still speaking and resulted in the patient trailing off and stopping mid-sentence. During one medical visit, the patient was describing her use of a medication when she changed topic and began to tell the practitioner about a wedding she had attended. The practitioner interrupted her by asking, \"Well, does it help you?\" referring to the medicine that the patient had not finished talking about, and the patient returned to medication discussion. Discussion Discussion Results indicate use of specific communication strategies during older adult and practitioner pain discussions and support the utility of CAT in examining pain communication between practitioners and older adults. Although CAT has been used for communication research in multiple settings (Jones et al., 1999; Ryan, Hamilton, & See, 1994; Jones, Woodhouse, & Rowe, 2007), results from the present study offer an extension into the ambulatory medical visit setting. Despite reporting an average moderate pain level, several patients did not discuss their osteoarthritis pain with their practitioners. Many older adults fail to seek help for their osteoarthritis pain (Shi, Langer, Cohen, & Cleeland, 2007) and may consider a certain amount of health decline to be normal (Coupland & Coupland, 1994). Older adults may have unique preconceived ideas on what aging is supposed to be like that may limit the information they volunteer in an ambulatory medical visit. Therefore, practitioners might need to screen for osteoarthritis pain so that they can get a comprehensive report of overall health status. Coupland and Coupland (1994) suggest that practitioners have a choice when talking with older adults to either reinforce a patient's preconceived ideas about health status or help to reconstruct the patient's health expectations. Practitioners may be missing opportunities to improve the daily functioning of patients with osteoarthritis pain. The fact that the majority of older adults did bring up the pain topic may be a positive result of the pain information videos or pain communication virtual coach that patients watched before their ambulatory medical visits. Regardless of the reason for patient selection of the pain topic, older adults demonstrated use of the discourse management strategy as a way of managing their role as an active participant in their own health care. Wagner (1998) suggests that patients should become the ultimate manager of their chronic illness (such as osteoarthritis) using skills such as self-advocacy and communication of important clinical information about pain. A majority of older adults failed to maintain focus on the pain discussion. When a patient either changes the topic of discussion or responds to the practitioner change of subject, there is a risk that they may not reveal all of their pain information. Practitioners should not assume that because patients leave the pain topic that they are finished revealing all of their pain information (Porter, Keefe, Wellington, & de Williams, 2008). Porter et al. (2008) demonstrated that patients may hold back pain information when discussing it because patients may not know what information is useful. Practitioners have a choice of discourse management strategies that control the conversation and risk a reduced amount of information exchange or that seek to engage the patient fully as a partner in communication (Coupland et al., 1988). There were exchanges that showed that practitioners used these positive strategies, but perhaps not as often as they could have. Only one-third of the pain discussions were opened by the practitioners asking open-ended questions without social desirability. This was lower than found by Marvel, Epstein, Flowers, and Beckman (1999), where 75% of practitioners opened discussions with patients using open-ended questions for all ambulatory medical visits (not limited to pain discussion.) This discrepancy might be indicative of practitioners' lack of confidence when treating persistent osteoarthritis pain and may suggest a possible reason for the undertreatment of the pain associated with this disease (Weiner, Turner, Henon, Perera, & Hartman, 2005). Using an open-ended question without social desirability has been shown to help improve the amount of information that older adults reveal about their osteoarthritis pain and should be encouraged in practitioner training (McDonald, et al., 2009). A possible reason that practitioners may not use more open-ended questioning could be an effort to manage their time if they feel pressured to hurry through office visits. The frequency of practitioners interrupting patients during medical visits has been shown in the literature to occur more frequently than observed in the present study and is generally regarded to be negative (Marvel et al., 1999). Of the two identified practitioner interruptions in the present study, one resulted in the practitioner helping to refocus the patient back to the pain content discussion, which suggests that interruptions may not always be negative. Interruptions have been shown to reduce the amount of pain information that older adults reveal (McDonald & Fedo, 2009), but CAT recognizes that there are complex levels of human motivation and behavior behind the choices of how people speak to each other (Jones et al., 1999). Although interruptions are generally disruptive in medical visits (Realini, Kalet, & Sparling, 1995), it is possible that the practitioner chose this communication strategy to improve the quality and flow of information that was relevant to the patient's health status. Ryan, Giles, Bartolucci, and Henwood (1986) suggest that quality communication can be defined as effective transmission of information and comprises an essential part of the psychologic and physical health of the older adult. One of the ways that practitioners can aid older adults with their osteoarthritis pain during ambulatory medical visits is to make sure that all of the important pain information is exchanged. Pain discussions represent a complex multidimensional communication opportunity between older adults and practitioners (Ryan et al., 1986) and it is possible that an appropriately timed interruption may be the correct choice (accommodation) during some conversations. Li, Zhang, Yum, Lundgren, and Pahal (2008) describe one style of interruptions as cooperative in nature. Their study showed practitioner use of cooperative interruption led to an improvement in patient confidence in the expertise of the practitioners (Li et al., 2008). Owing to the limitations of the present study, its findings should be cautiously interpreted. This study was a secondary analysis with all older adults receiving one of two forms of pain communication education before the ambulatory medical visit. Older adults without such prior educational support might not talk about their osteoarthritis pain or might converse differently. Participants were required to have a pain level of ≥4 in the month before the office visit to participate, but some participants reported pain scores of &lt;4 on the actual day of the ambulatory medical visit, which may have affected the amount of pain content they discussed. Additional limitations include the use of transcripts and audiotaped conversations. Transcripts do not convey tone of voice or rate of speech. Audio tapes limit the communication information available for analysis to what was spoken, with no ability to observe body language or other aspects of the ambulatory medical visit (such as computer use by practitioner.) Additionally, the small sample size and single setting reduce the ability to generalize. This study was also limited by the lack of diversity of the participants, who were primarily highly educated white women. Finally, it is possible that participants were subject to the Hawthorne effect, because both the older adults and the practitioners were consented and aware that they were in a study examining osteoarthritis pain communication and might have responded differently as a result. Implications for future research include expanding coding to examine the types of interruptions (positive versus negative) that occur throughout the ambulatory medical visit and to examine the effect on the pain information communicated by patients. Replication with a larger and more diverse sample across multiple practice sites is needed. Extension to other age groups and other common painful conditions, such as cancer pain or fibromyalgia pain, might suggest ways to improve pain discussion and treatments with other vulnerable groups. An additional category to be coded would be the patient use of the discourse management behaviors that reinforce age-related stereotypes, which may reveal how older adults view their osteoarthritis pain: as either a normal part of aging or as a condition that should be treated (discourse attuning process of tenor). This kind of analysis might help to bring to light some of the reasons that so many older adults are undertreated for their osteoarthritis pain. The addition of observations or videotaping of the ambulatory medical visits would allow a more comprehensive examination of the types of interruptions that occur, such as interruption by a third party and how the interruptions change patient communication of pain information. In conclusion, CAT offers an insightful and easily applied framework for examining the communication that occurs between practitioners and older patients with osteoarthritis pain. Unlike studies that examine primarily the practitioner side of an ambulatory medical visit, studies that use the CAT strategies of discourse management and interpersonal control offer a possible way to understand how patients and practitioners interact to affect information exchange. Practitioners need to be aware of the effect of their communication on their patients. By consciously suspending preconceived ideas and diagnostic judgments, practitioners might more fully use open-ended questions with no social desirability and discourse management behaviors that encourage patients to take turns and communicate more comprehensive pain information. Patients need to be helped to understand their role in providing concise yet complete pain information to practitioners. Older adults can be encouraged to understand their role in their own pain management by teaching them to use CAT strategies of discourse management and interpersonal control in positive ways. Patients should be taught to start the conversation regarding their osteoarthritis pain to make sure that it does not get missed. Patients should also learn to take their turn when discussing pain until they have discussed all of their relevant pain information. Training practitioners to open ambulatory medical visits with open-ended questions without social desirability and teaching older adults to maintain focus on their pain issues until they have described all of their information might result in more beneficial pain management discussions.

In addition to the characteristics of the analgesic, the individual receiving treatment must be considered in terms of co-morbidities affecting the metabolism and safety of the medication (Ahmed, 2011; Pasero, Quinn, Portenoy, McCaffery, & Rizos, 2011). A review of the literature assessed the current evidence related to individual co-morbidities affecting analgesia usage. An electronic search of the CINAHL and Google Scholar databases was conducted using the following search terms: postoperative pain , postoperative pain management , effects of pain on the body , ad verse effects of pain , how pain affects the body , physiologic consequences of pain , physiologic response to pain, consequences of unrelieved pain , effects of unrelieved pain , pain medication recommendations for postoperative pain , medication recommendation for postoperative pain based on pain scale , medication guidelines for postoperative pain based on pain scale , opioid guidelines for postoperative pain based on pain scale , barriers to postoperative pain management , obstructive sleep apnea , opioid use in obstructive sleep apnea , use of opioid analgesics in patients with OSA , PROcedure-SPECific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) , PROSPECT studies , and Joint Commission guidelines for pain management . Limits were set to include full text, date range since 2008, English language, and adult patients. Other appropriate sources contained in the reference lists of the searched literature were considered, leading to identification of 45 articles and 14 guidelines/protocols. Three were not useful and were excluded. Seven relevant reference books on the topic of pain management were consulted and information from these books was included. A decision tree model flowchart then was developed to offer analgesia options based on the type of pain as well as individual patient characteristics or co-morbidities. Individual Factors Affecting Analgesic Use Individual Factors Affecting Analgesic Use Co-Morbidities Dysfunction or failure of major organs, particularly the liver and kidneys, impacts the distribution, clearance, and excretion of opioids. Because the liver plays a major role in the metabolism of opioids, its failure can cause decreased metabolism, delayed elimination, and in creased bio availability of these medications. This results in in creased half-life and a higher than expected plasma concentration, which in turn may cause in creased adverse effects of respiratory depression or sedation (Hallingbye, Martin, & Viscomi, 2011). Renal insufficiency also interferes with the elimination of drugs and decreases clearance, resulting in increased half-life and an increased incidence of adverse effects such as central nervous system and respiratory depression (Parmar & Parmar, 2013). Individuals with renal insufficiency also may have increased accumulation of active metabolites of drugs, which may cause significant adverse effects. Lower opioid doses and in creased patient monitoring thus are recommended for patients with renal or liver dysfunction (Pasero et al., 2011). Drug Tolerance When choosing an opioid dose, the health care provider must determine if the patient is opioid naïve or opioid tolerant. An opioid-naïve individual has not been taking opioids regularly in the recent past. An opioid-tolerant individual has been taking opioids regularly and has developed tolerance to their effects. Without understanding these characteristics, the health care provider could overdose an opioid-naïve person or under-dose an opioid-tolerant individual. Generally, the opioid-naïve patient will need smaller doses of the opioid to achieve an analgesic effect while the opioid-tolerant person will need larger doses. Following surgery, pa tients who also are being treated with opioids for chronic pain will require higher doses of opioids than opioidnaïve persons (Huxtable, Roberts, Somogyi, & Macintyre, 2011). One study suggested the opioid requirement may be two to four times higher for the opioid-tolerant individual. The nurse should monitor this patient closely for sedation and respiratory depression (Pasero et al., 2011). Recommendations for Special Populations Recommendations for Special Populations Older Adults Older adults commonly experience pain. Barriers to effective recognition and treatment of pain in older adults may be related to caregivers' misconceptions. These include beliefs that older adults have a higher pain tolerance, do not tolerate opioids, or are addicted easily to analgesics. In addition, older adults may fear the loss of independence, or believe acknowledging pain is a sign of weakness or pain is a punishment for past actions. Older adults also may not refer to a sensation as pain, instead describing it as soreness, aching, or hurting (Knight, 2012). Normal effects of aging may cause the presentation of pain to be different than in younger individuals. Physiologic conditions that typically cause pain in younger individuals may be present, but the usual expected pain may not be present. For example, classic appendicitis symptoms of pain and tenderness are rare in older adults (Ignatavicius, 2013; Knight, 2012). Declining renal function with aging causes slower elimination of medications, creating prolonged effects (Knight, 2012). Aging also may contribute to decreased blood flow and liver function. Such physiologic changes may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medications, resulting in higher rates of adverse effects (Pasero et al., 2011; Varner, 2012). A general rule when treating pain with analgesics in older adults is to start low and go slow, meaning to start with the lowest effective recommended dose and increase the dose slowly if needed (Knight, 2012). Older adults may obtain the same amount of pain management as younger patients with a lower opioid dose; however, there is variability among individuals and doses should be titrated to effect (Macintyre, Scott, Shug, Visser, & Walker, 2010). Short-acting analgesics should be used for episodic pain. Because the least invasive route of medication administration is recommended, oral administration should be used whenever possible (Knight, 2012). Intravenous opioids may be given safely in older adults (Hallingbye et al., 2011; Sieber & Barnett, 2011), making the IV route an acceptable option for postoperative patients who may be unable to take oral medications or liquids. A multi-modal pain management plan including nonopioid analgesics may reduce the amount of opioid analgesics required, also reducing the potential side effects of opioids (Sieber & Barnett, 2011). Caregivers may be hesitant to administer opioids to older adults due to the fear of causing confusion. Because the presence of pain itself also can cause delirium, opioids should not be withheld because of the presence of delirium. Very low doses may be given safely. Opioid-naïve individuals should be started with half the recommended low dose (Knight, 2012). In a descriptive study of 100 medical-surgical patients who developed delirium during hospitalization, data were collected from a retrospective chart review regarding risk factors for delirium present on admission (Robinson et al., 2008). In addition, researchers noted the type, administration schedule, number of doses, and total milligrams of analgesics received by the patients in the 24 hours before onset of delirium. Identified risk factors for delirium included vision impairment, hearing impairment, cognitive impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility, and dehydration. Mean age of study participants was 76.71. The most common documented symptom of delirium was disorientation. Re searchers calculated the amount of analgesic the patients could have received based on the health care provider's order. Patients in fact received an average of 27.67% of the amount they could have been given. Authors concluded un managed pain, when added to other risk factors for delirium, could be a precipitating factor for delirium. A similar study using a matched group design was done to determine if a difference existed in the amount of analgesia received by patients who developed delirium compared to patients who did not (mean age 80) (Robinson & Vollmer, 2010). Data were collected through retrospective chart review and a two-sample t -test was used to compare the groups on the dependent variable of percentage of allowed analgesic received. A significant difference was found in the amount of allowed analgesic used ( p &lt;0.001). The group that did not develop delirium used 48.21% of the allowed analgesic, while the group with delirium used 26.14% of the allowed analgesic. Authors suggested a relationship exists between low doses of analgesic and the development of delirium; however, a causal relationship could not be established. The Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults should be consulted by providers choosing medications for adults age 65 and older (The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012). It identifies medications for which the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits. The list was developed through systematic review and use of a modified Delphi method by a panel of 11 experts in geriatrics and pharmacology. Medications were divided into three categories: \"potentially inappropriate medications and classes to avoid in older adults, potentially inappropriate medications and classes to avoid in older adults with certain diseases and syndromes that the drugs listed can exacerbate, and finally medications to be used with caution in older adults\" (The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012, p. 1). Based on the Beers Criteria (The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012), several medications that may be used for pain management or as adjuncts are not recommended for use in older adults. For example, the opioid meperidine (Demerol®) should be avoided in older adults because it may cause neurotoxicity. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided because of the increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and peptic ulcer disease unless alternatives are ineffective and the patient can take medications to provide GI protection (e.g., proton pump inhibitor). Use of indo methacin (Indocin®) and ketorolac (Toradol®) should be avoided because of the risk of peptic ulcers and GI bleeding in individuals over age 75, or persons taking corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents. Use of NSAIDs also should be avoided in individuals with stages IV and V chronic kidney disease because of increased risk of kidney injury. Tricyclic antidepressants, which of ten are used as adjuncts to treat neuropathic pain, should be avoided because of anticholinergic effects that may cause sedation and orthostatic hypotension. Individuals With Renal Disease The long-term use of acetaminophen (Tylenol®) has been associated with renal disease; however, it is preferred over NSAIDs for individuals with renal insufficiency. NSAIDs' ability to block the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase 1 (COX 1) can cause decreased renal blood flow in individuals with volume depletion or hypotension, and cause renal ischemia and acute renal failure. Individuals with cardiac failure, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, or hypertension, or who take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may be more susceptible to perioperative renal failure caused by NSAID use (Pasero et al., 2011). NSAID and COX inhibitor use is not recommended in individuals with chronic renal failure (Macintyre et al., 2010; Pasero et al., 2011). Opioid excretion may be prolonged in the presence of renal disease, causing active metabolites of medications to accumulate. Accum ulation is most problematic when medications are administered orally and when meperidine is given, but morphine also may cause problems. Morphine should be avoided in individuals with end-stage renal disease. Codeine also should be avoided. Hydromorphone (Dilaudid®) or fentanyl (Sublimaze®) may be tolerated better than morphine for shortterm use. Fentanyl can accumulate when used long-term and is not removed by dialysis. Epidural or intrathecal routes allow administration of lower opioid doses and may be an alternative (Pasero et al., 2011). Individuals With Substance Use Disorders Treating pain in individuals who also have a substance use disorder can be both challenging and ethically distressing. Health care providers may be reluctant to prescribe opioids and nurses may be reluctant to administer them be cause they fear contributing to patients' addiction. Requests for analgesics by individuals with illnesses associated with chronic pain, such as sickle cell disease, may be misinterpreted by health care providers as drug-seeking behavior (Finney, 2010; Pasero & Portenoy, 2011). Addiction is a chronic neurologic and biologic disease influenced by genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors. It includes one or more of the following behaviors: \"inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems, or a dysfunctional emotional response\" (Ameri can Society of Addiction Medi cine, 2011, p. 2). Physical dependence is a normal physiologic response to the administration of opioids or other medication for more than 2 weeks (American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Pain Society, & American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2001; Pasero & Portenoy, 2011). The body adapts to the presence of the medication; if the medication is stopped or reduced suddenly, the body reacts with symptoms of withdrawal. Physical dependence does not indicate addiction (Pasero & Portenoy, 2011). Similarly, tolerance does not indicate addiction. Tolerance is adaptation by the body that causes decreased effects of the drug over time (American Academy of Pain Medicine et al., 2001; Pasero & Portenoy, 2011). Increased doses of the medication are needed (Pasero & Portenoy, 2011). Pseudoaddiction occurs when individuals demonstrate some behaviors asso ciated with addiction. Un like true addiction, however, the similar symptoms are related to unmanaged pain and will resolve when the pain is treated effectively (American Academy of Pain Medicine et al., 2001; Pasero & Portenoy, 2011). An individual having surgery is expected to have pain that must be treated, even if he or she has a history of a substance use disorder. Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as heat, cold, or massage, can be tried for mild-tomoderate acute pain. Nono pioid medications (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) are op tions as well. Nerve blocks also may be used (American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Acute Pain Management, 2012). Opioids should not be withheld if indicated for acute pain, al though the best choice of opioid is a pure opioid agonist or mu re ceptor agonist, such as morphine, methadone (Dolophine®), co deine, fentanyl, oxycodone, levorphanol, oxymorphone (Opana®), or hydromorphone (Pasero et al., 2011). Scheduled administration of medications on an around-the-clock basis is preferred (Pasero et al., 2011). Early consultation with addiction medicine and pain management specialists is recommended (Krupnick, 2009). Individuals with a substance use disorder generally require more opioid than opioid-naïve individuals because they have developed tolerance. Individuals who take opioids daily will need more than their usual daily dose to achieve pain management. They should continue their usual opioid dose (Eksterowicz, Quinlan-Colwell, Venderveer, & Menez, 2010; Pasero et al., 2011). Care must be taken to prevent withdrawal (Pasero et al., 2011). Individuals receiving methadone for the treatment of addiction should continue to receive their usual dose and receive a different opioid for the treatment of acute pain. This aids in medication tapering as acute pain resolves. Treatment of acute pain in individuals receiving buprenorphine (Bu prenex®) for the treatment of addiction is difficult because this drug binds to opioid receptors and blocks the action of opioids. When possible, buprenorphine should be stopped a few days before a surgical procedure. In the case of unplanned surgery or an accident, pain should be treated with mu opioids (e.g., morphine, methadone, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydro morphone) (Pasero et al., 2011) and may require high doses (Huxtable et al., 2011). Opioids should be administered on a schedule or using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump instead of on an as-needed basis to provide longer duration of analgesia and decrease adverse central nervous system effects (Drew & St. Marie, 2011). Individuals With Persistent Pain Individuals with persistent pain who are treated with daily doses of opioids also will have tolerance to opioids and will require larger doses than opioidnaïve persons (Macin tyre et al., 2010). Individuals who take daily doses of opioids should not be treated with a nonopioid regimen or with mixed opioid agonistantagonists (e.g., nalbuphine [Nubain®], butorphanol [Stadol®], buphrenorphine [Buprenex®], pentazocine [Talwin®]) because of the risk of opioid withdrawal (Macintyre et al., 2010; Oliver et al., 2012). The usual opioid dose should be maintained. Post-operatively, the additional opioid dose required may be 30%-100% greater than the dose required by an opioid-naïve individual. However, opioid doses must be individualized based on the person's response to the medication (Eksterowicz et al., 2010). Individuals With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Persons with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at greater risk of developing respiratory depression and sedation when receiving opioids. In addition to causing sedation that could lead to respiratory depression, opioids cause relaxation of the tongue and muscles of the upper airway (American Pain Society, 2008; Macintyre et al., 2011). These effects of opioids may intensify the mechanisms causing OSA. This challenges the health care provider to provide pain management while preventing respiratory complications. Several strategies may decrease the risk of respiratory complications in individuals with OSA receiving opioids for pain management. Patient-controlled analgesia should be used with caution, if at all; a basal or continuous rate should not be used because of the increased risk of respiratory depression (Adesanya, Lee, Greilich, & Joshi, 2010; Bolden, Smith, & Auckley, 2009; Jarzyna et al., 2011; Macintyre et al., 2010). The type of opioid used and its peak effect time, the patient's other medications, and his or her sedation level should be considered to help prevent respiratory depression (Jungquist, Karan, & Perlis, 2011). The use of capnography to measure expired carbon dioxide levels is recommended for use in individuals with OSA receiving opioids by PCA to detect early signs of respiratory depression (Jarzyna et al., 2011). Decision Tree Model Flowchart for Management of Postoperative Pain Decision Tree Model Flowchart for Management of Postoperative Pain A decision tree model flowchart is used to represent a decision process graphically (see Figure 1). Different symbols are used to signify specific actions taken at that step in the process. An oval shape indicates the beginning or end of the process, a rectangle indicates an action step, and a diamond indicates a decision (Hebb, 2012). Figure 1. Decision Tree Model Flowchart for Management of Postoperative Pain Figure 1: Decision Tree Model Flowchart for Management of Postoperative Pain Recommendations for the flowchart presented in Figure 1 were made based on the evidence for the type of pain as well as patient characteristics or comorbidities. Al though pain is expected to decrease with time following surgery, pain is subjective (Pasero & Portenoy, 2011); thus recommendations are made based on the intensity of pain rather than the postoperative day. Medications are given intravenously immediately after surgery. The transition to oral analgesics should be made as soon as possible when the individual is tolerating oral fluids. Due to possible hepatotoxic effects of acetaminophen, combination medications that include acetaminophen should be avoided; opioid and nonopioid medications should be given separately (Pasero et al., 2011). Nursing Implications Nursing Implications Providing safe, effective pain management is a concern to all nurses caring for patients following surgery. Registered nurses at all levels of practice are primary patient advocates who have a vital role in managing postoperative pain appropriately. Patient comorbidities create challenges to managing pain and preventing adverse effects caused by analgesics (Ahmed, 2011). The decision tree model concisely assembles current evidence while considering patient co-morbidities and medication characteristics. When using the decision tree to find recommendations for multi-modal pain management, the nurse first should identify the type of pain being experienced by the patient and then answer the questions. Each question under the type of pain should be answered because the patient may have more than one co-morbidity. The decision tree is followed until the interventions are reached. Nonopioid and opioid medications as well as nonpharmacologic interventions are suggested. Medications that should be avoided and other suggested cautions are based on the characteristics or co-morbidities of the individual patient. Conclusion Conclusion Pain management is a complex yet essential function for health care providers. Effective pain management is crucial for individuals following surgery to provide comfort, prevent complications, and allow the fullest recovery. A decision tree model flowchart was developed to guide selection of appropriate postoperative pain management methods. This chart can be used to assist clinicians to provide pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to pain management for special patient populations. ",

				"body": "The prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased with each new edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), raising concern among some experts that the condition is overdiagnosed, doing more harm than good. According to investigators led by Rae Thomas, PhD, from Bond University in Robina, Australia, reducing the threshold for diagnosing ADHD devalues the diagnosis in individuals who actually have serious problems and exposes those at the lower end of the diagnostic threshold to unnecessary and potentially harmful side effects from stimulant medications used to treat the disorder and may cause psychological harm from the stigma of such a diagnosis. \"There is such a large variation between and within countries regarding the prevalence of ADHD that it raises questions about diagnostic practices rather than children's symptoms,\" Dr. Thomas told Medscape Medical News . \"We think ADHD is overdiagnosed and that many children and their families may be harmed due to costs of medication, particularly if it is not needed, medication side effects, and psychological labels,\" she said. The article was published online November 5 in BMJ . Creating Self-fulfilling Prophecies According to Dr. Thomas, the cost of medication for an inappropriate ADHD diagnosis could be as much as $500 million in the United States alone. \"Medical costs can be very large for families, and if subsidized, can be costly for healthcare systems in general,\" she said. For most children diagnosed with ADHD, the condition is described as \"mild or moderate,\" and this is concerning because it is likely that these children will be prescribed medications. Yet, there is limited evidence of long-term medication benefits, but some short-term harms are known, she said. \"The drugs used to treat ADHD have side effects such as weight loss, weight gain, and growth problems, and we don't know whether they work in the long term.\" There are also psychological harms associated with an ADHD diagnosis. Dr. Rae Thomas 120 156 0 Dr. Rae Thomas \"When compared with children diagnosed with asthma, children diagnosed with ADHD have been described as lazier, less clever, less caring, and are more likely to be socially excluded,\" Dr. Thomas said. \"Also, teachers and parents may have preconceptions about the academic achievements of a child diagnosed with ADHD, and these can create self-fulfilling prophecies.\" Prescribing of methylphenidates and amphetamines in the United States increased steadily between 1996 and 2008, with the greatest increase in adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. In the Netherlands, prevalence and prescribing rates for children who had been diagnosed with ADHD doubled between 2003 and 2007. \"The pharmaceutical industry is one of the drivers of overdiagnosis, but there are others,\" Dr. Thomas said. \"Direct-to-consumer advertising can drive consumer demand and alter physician practices. Also, although this is meant to reduce stigma, celebrities' efforts to raise awareness about ADHD can help drive overdiagnosis, and financial ties of pharmaceutical companies to patient advocacy groups have the potential to bias information,\" she said. Shifting definitions and unmet criteria also contribute to overdiagnosis of ADHD. Changes to the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD were estimated to raise prevalence rates by 15%, but this was exceeded, Dr. Thomas said. Of particular concern to the researchers is the subjectivity of the impairment criterion for making the diagnosis of ADHD. \"DSM-IV stated that an individual had to experience 'clinically significant' impairment in a range of settings, suggesting a large degree of impairment. However, DSM-5 reworded the criterion to \"interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic, or occupational functioning,\" which suggests some impairment,\" Dr. Thomas said. DSM-IV criteria required symptoms to be present by the age of 7 years, but now DSM-5 has increased that to 12 years, which expands the age of onset. \"Raising of the age of onset will raise the prevalence further as the threshold for diagnosis has widened, so you are lowering impairment criterion at one end and raising the age a person has to have experienced symptoms at the other,\" Dr. Thomas said. Troubling Conclusions Commenting on the article for Medscape Medical News , Harold S. Koplewicz, MD, president of the Child Mind Institute in New York City, said that he was troubled by some of the authors' conclusions. \"Sometimes the increase in diagnosis means that kids who weren't getting the attention they needed are now getting it because of increased access to care, better information, or a decrease in the stigma that has so long been attached to seeking mental health care,\" he said. Dr. Koplewicz conceded that there is always a danger of inappropriate diagnosis or overtreatment. But, he said, there is a bigger risk of not diagnosing ADHD. \"The kids who don't get diagnosed or don’t get treatment are at heightened risk for substance abuse, at higher risk for school dropout, for having more car accidents, and having a higher risk of having an interaction with the juvenile justice system,\" he said. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can now be used to differentiate between children who have typical brains vs children who have ADHD, he said. \"We're not in the Dark Ages. These are real disorders that clearly do come in mild, moderate, or severe forms. Not every kid who has a mild form of this needs treatment, but children who are experiencing distress or disruption, who are very unhappy because they're constantly struggling and can't make friends, can't sit still long enough to follow instructions, who are always being yelled at by their parents, those kids need a diagnosis, and they need treatment that works,\" Dr. Koplewicz said. The fact that the prescribing of drugs to treat ADHD has increased in the United States and the Netherlands is not necessarily a bad thing, he added. \"There are hundreds of studies that show that the psychostimulants are effective for children who have ADHD. And these children need effective treatment.\" Meds Are Effective Dr. Koplewicz also took issue with the authors' claims of little evidence for long-term benefit for the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. \"The authors state that there is little data on long-term benefits with treatment, but that is not true. It's like taking insulin; if you stop taking it, your diabetes will flare up and you will die from your diabetes, but you can't say that insulin gives you long-term benefit. \"In the same way, if you take your medication for ADHD, you are more likely to stay in school, you are more likely to be able to use the IQ points you have. The medicine won't give you more IQ points, but it will help you get to the ones you do have.\" Dr. Koplewicz also spoke of the authors' focus on adverse drug reactions with ADHD drugs. \"Any pill has side effects. Aspirin can kill you. Tylenol has side effects. Any time you take a drug, there is a cost-benefit ratio. You have to be an informed consumer. Parents should be aware that, yes, for some kids, there is some temporary weight loss, but I have never seen a kid get suicidal on psychostimulants in all my years of practice.\" He also countered that the research currently being done on ADHD is relevant and will ultimately lead to better ways to diagnose the disorder. \"Let's not count out the research, because much of the research funding is focused on biomarkers for ADHD. We at Child Mind, and others, are trying very hard and investing a tremendous amount of time and resources trying to identify an objective marker, including the differences seen on fMRI between kids who have the disorder with kids who do not.\" No Biomarker Yet Finding objective tests for psychiatric disorders is important because once such tests are found, some of the stigma associated with these disorders will disappear. \"If you have an objective test, you are going to get treatment. Unfortunately with ADHD, we do not have a biological marker. I don't believe that the public recognizes how real, how common, and how treatable these disorders are,\" he said. Broadening the definition of ADHD to include onset of symptoms before the age of 12 vs the age of 7 is also a positive step, Dr. Koplewicz said. \"These are important years because there are a lot of kids who do not have hyperactivity but do have ADHD inattentive type. But when they are in elementary school, they have a very controlling, superengaged teacher and very involved mother and father. Especially if it is a bright kid, you won't see the symptoms of ADHD because the child is being controlled. \"But then you put that kid in the 5th grade, in middle school, and now the child is moving from one class to another, with 7 different teachers, and no matter how smart that kid is, if he or she is more impulsive than the average kid and less attentive, then all of a sudden the child becomes a C student where before they were an A or a B student. And that is because they've lost their executive assistant or parent to guide them. \"Their world has become much less organized, and we know that ADHD becomes more prevalent as the world gets more disorganized. So changing the onset of symptoms from 7 to 12 will pick up a lot more children with ADHD,\" he said. On the other hand, the article does touch on important issues, but it does not go deep enough, Dr. Koplewicz concluded. \"The fact is, it's a more complex situation. We might be overdiagnosing, misdiagnosing, and even overtreating certain kids, but the overwhelming majority of kids who have these disorders are going undiagnosed and untreated.\" Dr. Thomas and Dr. Koplewicz report no relevant financial relationships .

Two batches of the red blood cell booster -- originally containing about 200,000 syringes -- were involved in the voluntary recall from 17 countries, including Britain, France and Germany. The other countries involved in the latest recall were Canada, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Russia, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Albania, Egypt, Israel and Taiwan, the company said. There have been no reports of harm to patients from the affected Eprex batches, said J&J spokesman Stefan Gijssels. \"The batches were already delivered to market quite a while ago, so we assume the majority has already been consumed,\" Gijssels said in a telephone interview on Friday. J&J estimates that there should be less than 6,300 syringes remaining on the market that are actually affected by the recall. \"The company is working with regulatory authorities in 17 countries to voluntarily execute a recall of two batches of Eprex as a safety precaution,\" Gijssels said. A routine internal quality analysis found that a number of the syringes contained Eprex that was either above or below the required potencies, he said. J&J has endured waves of recalls across its various product lines, including hundreds of millions of bottles of adult and children's consumer medicines, such as Tylenol. The company has also had to recall faulty hip replacements, contact lenses, schizophrenia drugs and many other products over the past two years, and was forced to place some of its manufacturing plants under U.S. government supervision.
