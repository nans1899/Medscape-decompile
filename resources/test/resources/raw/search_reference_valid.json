				"body": "Overview Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV infection. [ 1,  2]  HIV, a positive single-stranded RNA virus, undergoes reverse transcription to produce double-stranded viral DNA, which is subsequently incorporated into the host genome and used to produce viral progeny using the host's cellular machinery. Abacavir competes with naturally occurring deoxynucleotides during the viral reverse transcription process. When incorporated into the growing viral DNA strand, abacavir blocks further strand elongation, leading to a premature halt in viral DNA synthesis and chain termination. Abacavir is generally well tolerated but can cause hypersensitivity in 5% to 8% of patients during the first 6 weeks of treatment. [ 3]  Symptoms include fever, rash, constitutional symptoms, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and respiratory symptoms. Symptoms worsen with continued usage and can be potentially life threatening if the patient is rechallenged after discontinuation. [ 3]  Hypersensitivity to abacavir is immunologically mediated, driven by conventional MHC-I antigen presentation and activation of HLA-B*5701. [ 4,  5,  6,  7]  Activation of HLA-B*5701 restricted CD8+ T cells results in the secretion of the inflammatory mediators TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and induces the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. [ 4]  It is thought that a derivative of the abacavir prodrug binds to an antigen-presenting cleft unique to HLA-B*5701, which explains why the drug does not cause a similar hypersensitivity syndrome in carriers of other HLA-B alleles and why compounds similar to abacavir do not react with HLA-B*5701. [ 4]  The HLA-B*5701 allele occurs at approximately 5% frequency in European populations, 1% in Asian populations, and less than 1% in African populations. Clinical Implications and Genetic Testing In immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity, HLA-B*5701 genotyping is associated with a negative predictive value of nearly 100% and a positive predictive value of approximately 50%. [ 8]  That is, patients without the allele are highly unlikely to develop an immunological hypersensitivity to abacavir, but only about half of those with the allele will develop such a reaction. Thus, although the carriage rate of the HLA-B*5701 allele is low, stratification of patients for abacavir treatment based on HLA-B*5701 genotyping could virtually eliminate immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity and appears to be a cost-effective healthcare practice. [ 8,  9]  Screening for HLA-B*5701 prior to initiation of abacavir therapy is widely recommended for abacavir-naive individuals. [ 10,  11,  12]  However, its necessity in low-risk populations, such as the Han-Chinese in Hong Kong, has been questioned. [ 13]  Abacavir’s FDA-approved  prescribing information  includes a black box warning about the risk of hypersensitivity in carriers of the allele and a recommendation about screening. HLA-B*5701–positive individuals should not be prescribed abacavir. That being said, a negative HLA-B*5701 test does not preclude the development of a nonimmunologic hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir or of a clinical hypersensitivity reaction to another antiretroviral agent that may be given along with abacavir. [ 8]  Genotyping should not substitute for clinical vigilance but can greatly reduce the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity by identifying patients at high risk before they are treated.  Better virological but not immunological responses to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) have been shown in HLA-B*5701-positive patients on nonabacavir regimens. In a British study, HLA-B*5701-positive patients were more likely to achieve viral suppression than negative patients on a nonabacavir regimen [hazard ratio=1.29, 95% confidence interval, CI (1.15-1.54)] and less likely to experience viral rebound [hazard ratio=0.61, 95% CI (0.37-0.99)].

				"body": "Overview Background An estimated 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide. [ 1]  In the United States, more than 1.2 million people have HIV infection, and almost 1 in 7 (14%) are unaware of their infection. The estimated incidence of HIV in the United States has remained stable in recent years, at about 50,000 new infections occurring each year. [ 2]  Significant advances in antiretroviral therapy have been made since the introduction of zidovudine (AZT) in 1987. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1 infection is now manageable as a chronic disease in patients who have access to medication and who achieve durable virologic suppression. [ 3]  Excess mortality among patients with AIDS was nearly halved in the HAART era (see the image below), but it remains approximately 5 times higher in patients with AIDS than in HIV-infected patients without AIDS. The strongest risk factors for excess mortality were viral load greater than 400 copies/mL (compared with < 400 copies/mL), CD4 +  count less than 200 cells/mL (compared with >200 cells/mL), and cytomegalovirus retinitis. [ 4]  Changes in survival of people infected with HIV. As therapies have become more aggressive, they... Changes in survival of people infected with HIV. As therapies have become more aggressive, they have been more effective, although survival with HIV infection is not yet equivalent to that in uninfected people. Modified from an original published by Lohse et al (2007), \"Survival of persons with and without HIV infection in Denmark, 1995-2005.\"  The CD4+ cell count thresholds for HAART initiation were recently raised from 350 to 500 cells/mL in the United States and from 200 to 350 cells/mL in mid- and low-income countries. Data suggest that these recommendations mean a substantial increase in the number of patients who will require treatment and need early HIV testing. [ 5]  HAART provides effective treatment options for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Six classes of antiretroviral agents currently exist, as follows: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) Fusion inhibitors (FIs) Chemokine receptor antagonists (CCR5 antagonists) Each class targets a different step in the viral life cycle as the virus infects a CD4 +  T lymphocyte or other target cell. The use of these agents in clinical practice is largely dictated by their ease or complexity of use, side-effect profile, efficacy based on clinical evidence, practice guidelines, and clinician preference. Resistance, adverse effects, pregnancy, and coinfection with hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus present important challenges to clinicians when selecting and maintaining therapy. This article reviews the mechanism of action, resistance, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of each of these classes, as well as current treatment guidelines for their use in adults and adolescents with HIV infection. Also discussed are the important challenges involved in selecting and maintaining antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women and patients with acute HIV infection, hepatitis B or C coinfection, or  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  coinfection.

Although less potent against HIV than non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs),  protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), the NRTIs have had a central role in antiretroviral treatment and remain part of the current standard of care. [ 8,  6]  They exhibit activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2. [ 9]  A total of 9 drugs make up the NRTI class; 8 are currently commercially available in the United States, as follows: Abacavir  (ABC, Ziagen) Didanosine  (ddI, Videx) Emtricitabine  (FTC, Emtriva) Lamivudine  (3TC, Epivir) Stavudine  (d4T, Zerit) Tenofovir  DF  (TDF, Viread, part of the combination product Stribild) Tenofovir AF (TAF, part of the combination product Genvoya) Zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid; no longer available in the United States) Zidovudine  (ZDV, Retrovir; formerly azidothymidine [AZT]) Mechanism of action NRTIs interrupt the HIV replication cycle via competitive inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase and termination of the DNA chain. [ 10]  Reverse transcriptase is an HIV-specific DNA polymerase that allows HIV RNA to be transcribed into single-strand and ultimately double-strand proviral DNA and incorporated into the host-cell genome. Proviral DNA chain elongation is necessary before genome incorporation can occur and is accomplished by the addition of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides to the 3’ end of the growing chain. NRTIs are structurally similar to the DNA nucleoside bases and become incorporated into the proviral DNA chain, resulting in termination of proviral DNA formation. [ 11]  Tenofovir, lamivudine, and emtricitabine exhibit activity against  hepatitis B virus  (HBV) in addition to HIV and are frequently incorporated into antiretroviral regimens for patients with HIV and HBV coinfection. [ 6]  Resistance Resistance to NRTIs occurs by one of two mechanisms: (1) impaired incorporation into the proviral DNA chain or (2) removal from the proviral DNA chain. [ 12]  Mutations typically occur gradually, with accumulation of several mutations required before clinically significantly resistance develops. An exception is the M184V mutation, which confers high-level resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine in a single step. Mutations that selectively impair incorporation into the proviral DNA chain include M184V, Q151M, and K65R. Thymidine analog mutations (mutations associated with zidovudine resistance [M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y, T215F, K219Q, K219E]) remove NRTIs from the DNA chain by fostering a conformational change in the reverse transcriptase domain that allows the addition of ATP or pyrophosphate to the end. This placement causes a break in the proviral DNA and NRTI bond, enabling continued elongation of the proviral DNA strand. [ 11,  12]  Pharmacokinetics NRTIs are prodrugs and must undergo phosphorylation by intracellular kinases to exert their activity. Collectively, the oral bioavailability of NRTIs ranges from 25%-93%, with tenofovir and didanosine on the lower end of the spectrum. Food does not significantly affect absorption of any of the NRTIs except didanosine, which must be taken on an empty stomach to achieve optimal absorption and drug levels. Although serum half-lives of NRTIs are relatively short, intracellular drug levels are the best indicator for drug activity and determine the dose administered for each NRTI. [ 13]  Most NRTIs are renally eliminated and require dose adjustments in patients with renal insufficiency; the exception is abacavir, which is given at the normal dose regardless of creatinine clearance. NRTIs are not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system; therefore, minimal drug-drug interactions occur. Interactions that have been found to be clinically significant involve didanosine. When given in combination with tenofovir, didanosine levels are higher than expected, and lower doses must be given to avoid potentially serious adverse effects. A similar scenario has been demonstrated when didanosine is combined with ribavirin in the treatment of patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. This combination should be avoided. [ 6]  Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir that has high antiviral efficacy similar at a dose less than one-tenth that of the original formulation of tenofovir prodrug (ie, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]). TAF provides lower blood levels, but higher intracellular levels compared with TDF. [ 14,  15]    Adverse events Adverse effects of the NRTI class include mitochondrial toxicities (eg, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, hepatic steatosis, lipoatrophy). [ 6]  Mitochondrial toxicities are due to NRTI binding to human mitochondrial DNA polymerase-γ enzyme, impairing cellular respiration. Under these conditions, normal aerobic metabolism shifts to an anaerobic process, resulting in the above manifestations. Antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease along with CD4 cell restoration and suppression of plasma viral load, despite an increased risk that is associated with initial treatment regimens that include tenofovir plus a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. [ 16]  Binding affinity for mitochondrial DNA polymerase-γ by each NRTI is predictive of adverse-effect potential and varies as follows (in decreasing order of affinity): zalcitabine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine/emtricitabine, zidovudine, abacavir, and tenofovir. [ 17,  18]  Individual drug-specific adverse effects include bone marrow suppression, myopathy, and headache with zidovudine and a systemic hypersensitivity reaction with abacavir. [ 6]  Abacavir and didanosine have been associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events. [ 19]  Initiation of ART is associated with increased bone turnover and bone loss from the spine and hip, with a number of subjects losing about 6% bone mass density within 1 year after starting treatment. [ 20]  Adverse effects with the remaining NRTIs are included in Table 1. [ 6]  Although not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, those with moderate renal impairment can take TAF. Tenofovir AF appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and less decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens. [ 14,  21]  Patients given E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide had significantly smaller mean serum creatinine increases than those given E/C/F/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (0.08 vs 0.12 mg/dL; P<0.0001), significantly less proteinuria (median % change -3 vs 20; P<0.0001), and a significantly smaller decrease in bone mineral density at spine (mean % change -1·30 vs -2·86; P<0·0001) and hip (-.0·66 vs -2·95; P<0.0001) at 48 weeks. [ 14]  In clinical trials, patients receiving elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF (Genvoya) showed greater increases in serum lipids (total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein) than those receiving other ART regimens, but the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio was unchanged for both. [ 14]  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were introduced in 1996 with the approval of nevirapine. NNRTIs exhibit potent activity against HIV-1 and are part of preferred initial regimens. [ 8,  6]  Efavirenz, in particular, confers the most significant inhibition of viral infectivity among the NNRTIs. [ 8]  First-generation NNRTIs include  delavirdine  (Rescriptor),  efavirenz  (Sustiva), and  nevirapine  (Viramune). Second-generation NNRTIs currently include  etravirine  (Intelence), approved for use in the United States in 2008, and  rilpivirine  (Edurant) [ 22]  approved in 2011. In May 2017, it was announced that delavirdine has been discontinued in the U.S. with an estimated availability for the 100-mg tablets until October 2018 and for the 200-mg tablets until February 2020. All NNRTIs exhibit the same mechanism of action. First-generation NNRTIs share similar resistance patterns, whereas etravirine and rilpivirine display a more unique resistance profile. [ 23]  Their pharmacokinetic properties and adverse-effect profiles have important differences. Mechanism of action HIV reverse transcriptase is a heterodimer composed of 2 subunits (p66 and p51). [ 24]  NNRTIs bind the p66 subunit at a hydrophobic pocket distant from the active site of the enzyme. This noncompetitive binding induces a conformational change in the enzyme that alters the active site and limits its activity. [ 24]  Etravirine differs from first-generation NNRTIs in its ability to bind at this site despite the presence of some mutations that limit the efficacy of first-generation agents. It is a highly flexible molecule that is able to rotate within the binding site to allow multiple binding conformations. [ 25]  All four NNRTIs exhibit activity against HIV-1 isolates. In vitro studies have shown that etravirine also has activity against HIV-2. [ 26]  Resistance Mutations within the reverse transcriptase gene domain alter the ability of the NNRTIs to bind the enzyme. First-generation NNRTIs have a low genetic barrier to resistance, whereby a single mutation in the binding site can decrease the ability of the drug to bind, significantly diminishing activity. [ 27]  First-generation NNRTI resistance has been associated with mutations at multiple codons; however, the presence of either a K103N or Y181C mutation is sufficient to cause clinical failure of delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine. [ 27]  Associated mutations include the following [ 27]  : Delavirdine - A98G, L100I, K101E, K103N, K103T, V179D, Y181C, Y188L, M230L, P236L, Y318F Efavirenz - L100I, K101E, K103N, V108I, V179D, Y181C, Y188L, G190S, M230L Nevirapine - A98G, L100I, K101E, K103N, V106A, V106I, V108I, Y181C, Y191I, Y188C, Y188H, G190A, P225H, M230L, P236L, Y318W Etravirine has a higher genetic barrier to resistance than other currently available NNRTIs. A single mutation at 103 or 181 is insufficient to cause clinical failure of etravirine. [ 28]  Clinical trials have identified 17 resistance mutations associated with decreased response to etravirine: V90I, A98G, L100I, K101E, K101H, K101P, V106I, E138A, V179D, V179F, V179T, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, G190A, G190S, and M230L. [ 29]  A 2008 study found that different mutations affect viral susceptibility to etravirine to varying degrees. Each etravirine resistance-associated mutation was assigned a relative weight. The virologic response was found to be a function of the number and weight of resistance mutations. With a cumulative score of 0-2, a response rate of 74% was reported. With a score of 2.5-3.5 or 4 or more, response rates of 52% and 38%, respectively, were reported. [ 29]  The etravirine mutation weighting scheme is as follows [ 29]  : 3 - Y181I, Y181V 2.5 - L100I, K101P, Y181C, M230L 1.5 - V106I, E138A, V179F, G190S 1 - V90I, A98G, K101E, K101H, V179D, V179T, G190A Pharmacokinetics NNRTIs display considerable interindividual variability in their pharmacokinetic properties. All currently approved NNRTIs utilize the cytochrome P450 system for metabolism and exert varying induction and inhibition effects on specific isoenzymes (eg, CYP3A4, CYP2C9). This results in a significant potential for drug-drug interactions (see Table 2 and Table 3, under Tables of Antiretroviral Drug Interactions, below). [ 25,  30]  Delavirdine primarily uses the 3A4 isoenzyme for metabolism. Nevirapine is metabolized mainly by 3A4 with some secondary metabolism through 2B6. Efavirenz is primarily metabolized through 2B6 and secondarily through 3A4. Etravirine is a substrate of 3A4, 2C9, and 2C19. With the exception of nevirapine, the NNRTIs are highly protein-bound (98-99%), primarily to albumin and alpha 1  acid glycoprotein. The serum half-lives of the NNRTIs are fairly extended, ranging from 25-55 hours, except for delavirdine, which has a shorter half-life (2-11 h). [ 25,  30]  Adverse events Rash, which is the most common adverse effect associated with all NNRTIs, [ 6]  usually develops within the first few weeks of therapy and resolves with continued treatment. [ 6,  25,  31]  All NNRTIs except etravirine have the ability to cause some degree of hepatotoxicity. [ 25,  32]  Delavirdine and efavirenz can increase transaminase levels, while nevirapine can cause severe toxicity, including hepatic necrosis in patients with CD4 counts that exceed 250 cells/µL. [ 6,  33]  Efavirenz is unique among NNRTIs, causing CNS effects such as insomnia, vivid dreaming, dizziness, confusion, and hallucinations. Tolerance to efavirenz-related CNS adverse effects commonly occurs after several weeks of therapy. Bedtime administration and avoidance of food at the time of administration can minimize the intensity of adverse effects. CNS effects may persist in a small number of patients, requiring drug discontinuation. [ 6]  Gutiérrez-Valencia et al found that gradual upward titration of efavirenz over 2 weeks reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms and insomnia. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial that included 114 patients, those patients who received a full dose of 600 mg daily from day 1 had a higher incidence and severity of dizziness (66% vs 32.8%), hangover (45.8% vs 20.7%), impaired concentration (22.9% vs 8.9%), and hallucinations (6.1% vs 0%) during the first week, compared with patients who had gradual efavirenz titration to 600 mg daily by day 14. [ 34]  During week 2, the incidence of these aforementioned adverse events was similar in each group; however, severity was greater in the full-dose group. Virologic and immunologic efficacy was similar in both groups. [ 34]  Protease Inhibitors HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) were first introduced in 1995 and are an integral part of treatment of HIV infection. [ 6]  A total of 8 compounds are approved for use, as follows: Atazanavir  (Reyataz) Darunavir  (Prezista) Fosamprenavir  (Lexiva) Indinavir  (Crixivan) Lopinavir/ritonavir  (Kaletra) Nelfinavir  (Viracept) Saquinavir  (Invirase) Tipranavir  (Aptivus) Although all protease inhibitors exhibit the same mechanism of action, they have important differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse event profiles. Mechanism of action HIV protease is a 99-amino-acid, aspartic acid protein and is responsible for maturation of virus particles late in the viral life cycle. HIV protease systematically cleaves individual proteins from the  gag  and  gag  - pol  polypeptide precursors into functional subunits for viral capsid formation during or shortly after viral budding from an infected cell. HIV protease inhibitors function as competitive inhibitors that directly bind to HIV protease and prevent subsequent cleavage of polypeptides. [ 35]  They exhibit activity against clinical isolates of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. [ 35]  Resistance Resistance to HIV protease results from mutations both inside and outside the active protease domain. [ 36]  Resistance typically occurs through the development of one or more major mutations, which produce conformational changes in the protease binding site, followed by secondary compensatory mutations that improve enzymatic activity and, in some cases, viral fitness. [ 36]  Resistance to first-generation protease inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir) occurs with the development of one or more of the following primary mutations [ 36]  : G48V, L90M (saquinavir) M46I, V82A/L/F, I84V (indinavir) V82A/L/F, I84V (ritonavir) D30N, L90M (nelfinavir) I50L, I84V, N88S (atazanavir) I50V, I84V (fosamprenavir) Multiple mutations are typically necessary to cause high-level resistance to ritonavir-boosted (ie, coadministered with low-dose ritonavir to decrease intestinal and hepatic 3A metabolism, thereby increasing protease inhibitor serum concentration levels) protease inhibitors, which exhibit a higher genetic threshold for resistance than unboosted (ie, not coadministered with low-dose ritonavir) protease inhibitors. [ 37]  Cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors develops as the number of mutations increases. The second-generation protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir, and tipranavir may retain activity in the presence of resistance to first-generation agents. Lopinavir/ritonavir requires the accumulation of 7 or more mutations before high-level resistance develops. [ 36]  Darunavir and tipranavir typically retain activity against lopinavir/ritonavir and first-generation protease inhibitor–resistant strains. [ 36]  Eleven resistance mutations have been described for darunavir; accumulation of 3 or more is associated with virologic failure. Tipranavir also requires accumulation of multiple nonoverlapping mutations before high-level resistance develops. [ 36]  A review of 2725 HIV isolates for protease inhibitor susceptibility revealed that certain mutations could result in increased susceptibility to a particular drug, and that some effects on resistance had been underestimated. [ 38]  The study concluded that cross-resistance between the various protease inhibitors now and in the future may be missed without systematic analysis of the effects of specific mutations. Pharmacokinetics Protease inhibitors exhibit substantial interpatient and intrapatient variability in pharmacokinetics. [ 39]  Significant first-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5 and intestinal efflux by p-glycoprotein is observed. [ 39]  With the exception of indinavir, protease inhibitors are highly protein-bound (97-99%), primarily to albumin and alpha 1  acid glycoprotein. [ 6]  Distribution into the CNS is limited. Protease inhibitors have relatively short serum half-lives, ranging from 1.5-2 hours for indinavir and 7 hours for atazanavir. [ 6]  Reliance on metabolism through CYP3A4 results in significant potential for drug-drug interactions with other medications cleared through this pathway (see Table 2 and Table 3). Interactions with medications cleared through other CYP450 isoenzymes and phase II pathways (eg, glucuronidation) are possible, depending on the individual protease inhibitor. [ 6]  Low-dose ritonavir (100-200 mg) is frequently coadministered with other protease inhibitors to block intestinal and hepatic 3A metabolism. The addition of low-dose ritonavir improves pharmacokinetic variability, resulting in more consistent serum concentrations throughout the dosing interval and improved treatment response. [ 39]   Cobicistat is a newer agent that also blocks 3A metabolism and is used to enhance the pharmacokinetic profile of protease inhibitors. Adverse events Common adverse events associated with protease inhibitors include gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and metabolic complications (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance,  lipodystrophy ). Metabolic complications are common in patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy and represent an important consideration in selecting antiretroviral therapy. Dyslipidemia develops in up to 70% of patients receiving protease inhibitors and commonly requires institution of lipid-lowering therapy (ie, statins, fibrates, omega3 fatty acids). Drug interactions can preclude the use of some lipid-lowering agents (see Table 2). Lifestyle and genetic predisposition are important contributing factors to the type and severity of lipid abnormalities. [ 40]  In 1997, the FDA required that all protease inhibitors include labeling regarding the potential for hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus with therapy; however, the different protease inhibitors have significantly different propensities for affecting glucose metabolism. Indinavir exhibits the greatest potential for altering glucose metabolism. Modest effects have been observed with nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and tipranavir. Atazanavir (boosted or unboosted), darunavir, and saquinavir appear to have limited effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. [ 41]  Altered fat distribution (fat redistribution) occurs in 40-50% of patients receiving protease inhibitors in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). [ 42]  Common manifestations include fat accumulation (increased anterior cervical and dorsocervical fat, increased breast fat, centripetal obesity) or fat loss (sunken cheeks, wasted buttocks and extremities). Although both abnormalities may develop in the same patient, they are considered independent entities. Fat accumulation has been primarily associated with protease inhibitor therapy; however, more recent data demonstrate that it occurs with both protease inhibitor– and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)–based regimens. Numerous management strategies have been explored (eg,  metformin , recombinant human growth hormone, diet and exercise), with mixed results. Conversion from protease inhibitor–based therapy to a protease inhibitor–sparing regimen does not result in significant improvement and is not recommended. [ 43]  Adverse effects that occur with individual protease inhibitors need to be considered when selecting therapy for patients with other comorbidities. Asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia is common in patients who receive atazanavir and indinavir but does not require discontinuation of therapy in the absence of concomitant elevation in levels of liver transaminases. [ 6]  Nephrolithiasis occurs with indinavir and, less commonly, atazanavir. [ 6]  Cardiac conduction abnormalities (atrioventricular block, bundle branch block) develop in 5% of patients receiving atazanavir and have been reported with other protease inhibitors (ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir). [ 44]  Tipranavir may elevate levels of liver transaminases and should be avoided in patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C coinfection. Intracranial bleeding events have been reported during tipranavir therapy. [ 6]  Integrase Strand-Transfer Inhibitors The crystal structure of HIV integrase was first described in 1994 and led to the identification of novel inhibitors. [ 45]  No homolog for HIV integrase exists in humans; therefore, identification of selective inhibitors is expected to result in a low frequency of adverse effects. [ 46,  47]  The FDA approved  raltegravir  (Isentress) in 2007 as the first integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) available for use. [ 48]  In 2017, a once daily dosage form of raltegravir (Isentress HD) was approved for adults and adolescents who weigh at least 40 kg. It is administered as a 1200 mg once-daily dose that is given as two 600-mg tablets in combination with other antiretroviral agents in patients who are either treatment-naïve or virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of raltegravir 400 mg BID. The ONCEMRK clinical trial found raltegravir 1200 mg once daily to be noninferior to 400 mg BID. [ 49]  Elvitegravir  (Vitekta) is another agent integrase inhibitor that is used in combination with an HIV protease inhibitor (ie, atazanavir, lopinavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, or tipranavir) and coadministered with ritonavir plus other antiretroviral drug(s) as indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults. Elvitegravir was initially approved as a component of the FDA-approved ‘quad’ pill,  elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir  (Stribild). The 4-component tablet contains a complete once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve adults and includes elvitegravir, cobicistat (a CYP3A4 inhibitor without antiviral activity), emtricitabine, and tenofovir. [ 50]  Approval of the ART fixed-dose combination product was based on analyses of 48-week data from 2 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected individuals (n=1408). Results showed a single tablet regimen of Stribild met its primary objective of noninferiority compared to ( efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir ) fixed-dose combination (Atripla) and to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus  emtricitabine/tenofovir  (Truvada). [ 51,  52]  Dolutegravir  (Tivicay) was approved by the FDA in August 2013. An integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), dolutegravir was approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents in adults and children aged 12 years or older who weigh at least 40 kg. A wide-ranging phase III trial program included 2 trials in treatment-naïve patients. The first trial included 822 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve patients randomized to receive either dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) or raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) in combination with a fixed-dose dual-NRTI treatment. At week 48, virologic suppression was similar between the 2 groups; 88% for dolutegravir and 86% for raltegravir. [ 53]  The second trial also included treatment-naïve patients (n=833) and compared a once-daily dolutegravir regimen plus abacavir/lamivudine to once-daily efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Atripla). A statistically significant improvement in virologic suppression was observed with dolutegravir (88%) compared with Atripla (81%). [ 54]  A third phase III trial studied 719 treatment-experienced patients who were failing on current therapy, but who had not previously been treated with an integrase inhibitor. Participants were randomized to once-daily dolutegravir 50 mg or twice-daily raltegravir 400 mg. At week 24, 79% of patients on the regimen containing dolutegravir were virologically suppressed compared with 70% of patients on the regimen containing raltegravir. [ 55]  The VIKING-3 trial studied 183 treatment-experienced patients with resistance to multiple classes of HIV medicines, including resistance to integrase inhibitors. Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of twice-daily dolutegravir on viral load in these patients and found the regimen improved virologic suppression at 24 weeks (63%). However, poor response was observed with INSTI-resistance involving Q148 plus 2 or more INSTI resistance substitutions. [ 56]  Approval of dolutegravir for the indication in children aged 12 years or older was based on data in integrase-naïve patients. Mechanism of action HIV integrase is responsible for the transport and attachment of proviral DNA to host-cell chromosomes, allowing transcription of viral proteins and subsequent assembly of virus particles. [ 57]  Proviral integration involves 2 catalytic reactions, as follows: 3'-processing in the host-cell cytoplasm to prepare proviral strands for attachment Strand transfer whereby proviral DNA is covalently linked to cellular DNA These agents competitively inhibit the strand transfer reaction by binding metallic ions in the active site. [ 58,  59]  Resistance Mutations in the integrase gene are associated with resistance to raltegravir and elvitegravir. [ 60,  61,  62]  Two primary resistance pathways associated with raltegravir treatment failures in the BENCHMRK-1 and BENCHMRK-2 studies have been described, as follows [ 63]  : Q148K/R/H (25-fold decrease in susceptibility) N155H (10-fold decrease in susceptibility) The most common mutational sequence (Q148H/G140S) results in a greater than 100-fold decrease in susceptibility to raltegravir. [ 37]  A third resistance pathway involving mutations at Y143C/H/R has also been described for raltegravir but is uncommon. [ 64]  Secondary mutations (L74M/R, E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140S/A, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226D/F/H, S230R, D232N) confer additional resistance. [ 64]  Preliminary findings from clinical studies show that high-level resistance to elvitegravir is associated with mutations at E92Q in combination with E138K, Q148K/R/H, or N155H, leading to a 150-fold loss of susceptibility. Resistance patterns involving Q148H/G140S and Q148R/G140S demonstrate resistance to both elvitegravir and raltegravir, suggesting cross-resistance is likely. [ 65]  Pharmacokinetics Raltegravir exhibits rapid absorption and may be taken with or without food. Its terminal half-life of 10-12 hours supports twice-daily administration (400 mg twice daily). Sex-related differences in pharmacokinetics (longer half-life in women, lower C min  in men) have been observed but are not thought to be clinically significant. Raltegravir is 83% bound to plasma proteins and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein; the extent of penetration into the CNS remains to be determined. Metabolism occurs through uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Dosage adjustment is not required in patients with renal insufficiency or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Raltegravir exhibits low potential to affect the metabolism of other drugs; however, other antiretroviral agents may alter the metabolism of raltegravir. Antacids may decrease absorption by divalent cation binding, but no interaction with gastric acid suppressants (proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists) is expected. A relationship between raltegravir serum concentrations and viral suppression has not been established. [ 66,  67,  68]  Elvitegravir is administered with low-dose ritonavir (100 mg) to reduce its first-pass metabolism and systemic clearance. Ritonavir coadministration results in a 20-fold increase in systemic exposure and a terminal half-life of 10-13 hours. Elvitegravir is metabolized through CYP3A4 and UGT1A1/UGT1A3. Less than 7% is eliminated renally; therefore, the likelihood that dosing adjustments will be necessary in patients with renal insufficiency who receive elvitegravir is low. Drug-drug interactions with other medications are likely because of ritonavir coadministration. As with raltegravir, antacids may decrease absorption by divalent cation binding, but no interaction with gastric acid suppressants is expected. In dose-ranging studies, low elvitegravir trough concentrations have been associated with virologic failure in some patients. [ 68,  69,  70]  Adverse events Common adverse effects observed in clinical studies of raltegravir include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea) and headache. Laboratory abnormalities occurred at a frequency similar to other therapy in phase III studies and include grade 3-4 elevations in levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and amylase and lipase. Elevations in creatine kinase levels (grade 2-4) were observed with raltegravir in phase III studies, along with rare cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. [ 71,  72]  Raltegravir should be used with caution in patients receiving other medications that may increase the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. [ 72]  A relative risk of malignancy of 1.2 cases per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 0.4-4.1) has been reported in phase II and phase III clinical studies of raltegravir and requires continued surveillance. [ 71]  Gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea), fatigue, and headache have been most commonly observed with elvitegravir in limited clinical studies to date. [ 69]  Fusion Inhibitors Fusion inhibitors (FIs) were the first class of antiretroviral medications to target the HIV replication cycle extracellularly and received accelerated FDA approval in 2003. Their unique mechanism of action provides additional options for therapy in patients who are highly treatment resistant. The use of fusion inhibitors has been limited, however, because of the production time and costs, limited coverage from insurance companies and HIV drug-assistance programs (HDAPs), inconvenient administration (subcutaneous injection), and adverse effect profile. The discovery of additional antiretroviral classes and medications with activity against highly resistant viral strains has further limited the utility of the fusion inhibitors. Currently,  enfuvirtide  (Fuzeon) is the only product marketed in this class. Mechanism of action Fusion inhibitors act extracellularly to prevent the fusion of HIV to the CD4 or other target cell. Enfuvirtide blocks the second step in the fusion pathway by binding to the HR1 region of glycoprotein 41 (gp41). This mechanism does not allow HR1 and HR2 to fold properly, thereby preventing the conformational change of gp41 required to complete the final step in the fusion process. [ 73,  74]  Resistance Resistance to enfuvirtide has been well described and occurs in the HR1 domain of gp41. Amino acid substitutions occur in the 36-45 regions and result in significant loss of enfuvirtide activity. [ 75]  The risk of resistance can be minimized by combining enfuvirtide with other antiretroviral agents that display genotypic or phenotypic activity, which is now more easily achieved with the availability of second-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) and new antiretroviral classes (eg, integrase strand-transfer inhibitors [INSTIs] and CCR5 inhibitors). [ 76,  77]  Cross-resistance with other antiretroviral agents has not been demonstrated to date. Pharmacokinetics Enfuvirtide therapy requires twice-daily subcutaneous injection. It has not been shown to influence the metabolism of concomitant medications through the cytochrome P450 system. Dose adjustments are not required in patients with renal insufficiency or mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. Limited dosing data exist for patients with advanced liver disease; therefore, enfuvirtide should be used with caution in patients with hepatic decompensation. [ 6,  78]  Adverse events Most patients receiving enfuvirtide experience injection-site reactions, increasing drug discontinuation rates. Manifestations include subcutaneous nodules, erythema, pruritus, pain, and ecchymoses. Other adverse effects that occur to a lesser extent include diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. Hypersensitivity reactions have been described but are rare. Enfuvirtide has been associated with an increased risk for  bacterial pneumonia , but causality has not been established. [ 76,  77]  Chemokine Receptor Antagonists In August 2007,  maraviroc  (Selzentry) was approved by the FDA and was the first medication in a novel class of antiretroviral agents termed chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonists. It joins the fusion inhibitors (FIs) as another type of agent under the general antiretroviral treatment class of HIV-entry inhibitors. Mechanism of action The method by which HIV binds to CD4 cells and ultimately fuses with the host cell is a complex multistep process, which begins with binding of the gp120 HIV surface protein to the CD4 receptor. This binding induces a structural change that reveals the V3 loop of the protein. The V3 loop then binds with a chemokine coreceptor (principally either CCR5 or CXCR4), allowing gp41 to insert itself into the host cell and leading to fusion of the cell membranes. Maraviroc is a small molecule that selectively and reversibly binds the CCR5 coreceptor, blocking the V3 loop interaction and inhibiting fusion of the cellular membranes. Maraviroc is active against HIV-1 CCR5 tropic viruses. It has no activity against CXCR4 tropic or dual/mixed tropic virus. [ 79]  Resistance Although experience with maraviroc is limited, treatment failure due to resistance has been observed. Resistance appears to occur via one of two mechanisms. The first mechanism is most likely through amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop of gp120. Although the specific mutations associated with resistance have not yet been described, they appear to allow HIV binding to the coreceptor despite the presence of maraviroc. The second mechanism is not acquired resistance but rather the inability of phenotypic tropism assays to detect small quantities of CXCR4 virus that may be present, leading to overgrowth of CXCR4 virus in the presence of maraviroc and loss of viral control. The development of an enhanced tropism assay with higher sensitivity should minimize the frequency of this occurrence. [ 79,  80]  Genotypic assays can also be used to predict CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptor tropism by sequencing the gp120 V3 loop. These assays have shown good-to-excellent concordance with phenotypic assays. [ 81,  82]  Pharmacokinetics Maraviroc is approximately 75% protein-bound, primarily to albumin and alpha 1  acid glycoprotein. Its terminal half-life is 15-30 hours. Maraviroc is metabolized through CYP3A4 and is a substrate for the efflux pump p-glycoprotein. Dosage adjustment is required when maraviroc is administered in combination with potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. [ 79]  See Table 1. [ 6]  Adverse events Adverse events reported at a higher frequency than placebo in clinical studies include the following: Cough Pyrexia Upper respiratory tract infections Rash Musculoskeletal symptoms Abdominal pain Dizziness The rate of discontinuation due to adverse effects was similar to that found with placebo (4.9% and 5.3%, respectively). Postural hypotension is a dose-limiting effect that was discovered early in the development of maraviroc. In pooled analysis, postural hypotension occurred only in patients who received maraviroc at doses that exceeded 600 mg/day. The manufacturer warns that severe hepatotoxicity has been reported with maraviroc; caution should be used when maraviroc is administered to any patient predisposed to hepatic impairment. [ 79]  DHHS Treatment Guidelines Goals of therapy The US Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (DHHS ART Guidelines) issues recommendations for the administration of antiretroviral therapy. [ 6]  Guidelines are based on results of clinical studies and expert opinion and are updated on an ongoing basis. Separate guidelines address antiretroviral treatment for pregnant women, children, and individuals with potential occupational (eg, health care industry) and nonoccupational (eg, high-risk sexual encounters) exposure to HIV. Guidelines for antiretroviral treatment initiation in adults are also available from the International AIDS Society and the World Health Organization (WHO). The discussion of antiretroviral treatment strategies in this article focuses on recommendations from the DHHS Panel. The DHHS ART Guidelines present the following 5 overarching goals for therapy: Reduce HIV infection–related morbidity and prolong survival Improve quality of life Restore and preserve immunologic function Maximally and durably suppress viral load Prevent vertical HIV transmission Suppression of viremia also has the potential to reduce cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic events thought to be related to ongoing inflammation and immune activation from uncontrolled viremia. The risk for both AIDS-related and non–AIDS-associated malignancy may also be reduced by improved immunity. [ 6]  Treatment-naive patients Indications for initiating antiretroviral therapy The DHHS ART Guidelines recommend that therapy should be initiated in all patients irrespective of CD4 count to decrease the risk for HIV disease progression, non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality, and to prevent transmission of HIV infection.  The decision to begin antiretroviral therapy, as well as the selection of the individual antiretroviral components, should be tailored to each patient, taking into account patient-specific variables and preferences.  The patient’s readiness and commitment to lifelong therapy should similarly be evaluated.Data from the START and TEMPRANO randomized trials have shown compelling evidence regarding the benefit of initiating ART in HIV infected individuals with high CD4-cell counts (>500 cells/mL), rather than defer treatment until CD4-cell counts decline. [ 83,  84]  Findings from these studies showed a lower rate of death or severe HIV-related illness (eg, tuberculosis, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant lymphomas) in those who were treated early with ARTs compared to those that were deferred treatment until a lower CD4-cell count was observed. Therapy options Currently, 26 antiretroviral agents in 6 antiretroviral classes plus fixed-dose combination products are approved for use in the United States. These agents vary in their antiviral potency and administration requirements. It is currently recommended that antiretroviral therapy be initiated with 2 NRTIs in combination with an NNRTI, PI, or integrase inhibitor. [ 6]  In an attempt to simplify the selection of an initial regimen, the DHHS ART Guidelines have outlined preferred and alternative regimens for initiation in antiretroviral-naïve patients. There are now 5 recommended regimens for antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive patients — 4 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens and 1 ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-based regimen. The five preferred regimens have evidence ratings of AI (ie, strong recommendation with data from randomized controlled trials). These recommendations are based on efficacy and safety of these combinations, as well as other factors, including ease of administration. [ 6]  Preferred regimens for ART-naïve patients include the following: INSTI-based regimens See the list below: Dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq; DTG/ABC/3TC) a  —only for patients who are HLA-B*5701 negative Dolutegravir (DTG) + tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Truvada; TDF/FTC) a Elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Stribild; EVG/c/TDF/FTC)—only for patients with pre-ART CrCl >70 mL/min Raltegravir (RAL) + tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Truvada; TDF/FTC) a PI/r-Based Regimen See the list below: Darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) + tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada; TDF/FTC) a a  lamivudine (3TC) may be substituted for emtricitabine (FTC) or vice versa Alternative regimens for ART-naïve patients include the following: NNRTI-based Regimens See the list below: Efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Atripla; EFV/TDF/FTC) a Rilpivirine/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Complera; RPV/TDF/FTC) a  —only for patients with pre-treatment HIV RNA < 100,000 copies/mL and CD4 cell count >200 cells/mm 3 PI-based Regimens See the list below: Atazanavir/cobicistat (Evotaz; ATV/c) + tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada; TDF/FTC) a  — only for patients with pretreatment estimated CrCl ≥70 mL/min Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) + tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Truvada; TDF/FTC) a Darunavir/cobicistat or darunavir/ritonavir (Prezcobix; DRV/c or DRV/r) + abacavir/lamivudine (Epzicom; ABC/3TC) a  —only for patients who are HLA-B*5701 negative Darunavir/cobicistat (Prezcobix; DRV/c) + tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Truvada; TDF/FTC) a  —only for patients with pretreatment estimated CrCl ≥70 mL/min a  lamivudine (3TC) may be substituted for emtricitabine (FTC) or vice versa In a long-term study of treatment-naïve patients, raltegravir combined with tenofovir/emtricitabine delivered durable viral suppression and immune restoration that was at least equivalent to the combination of efavirenz and tenofovir/emtricitabine. In addition, fewer drug-related clinical adverse events and smaller elevations in lipid levels occurred in patients in the raltegravir combination group. [ 85]  Resistance One study has reported that antiretroviral resistance can be detected in 6-16% of treatment-naive individuals. [ 6]  Based on this possibility, DHHS guidelines recommend that resistance testing be performed in all patients with HIV infection at the onset of care. Genotypes are generally the test of choice, as de novo resistance to NRTIs or NNRTIs is most commonly observed. Genotypes are also less costly and exhibit a shorter turnaround time. If the interval between entering care and beginning antiretroviral therapy is significant, it is generally recommended that the patient undergo testing with another genotype to assess any resistance acquired in the interim. [ 6]  Therapy selection The antiretroviral regimen selected should be based on patient-specific factors and preferences. Factors to consider include associated comorbidities, the adverse-effect profiles of the medications being considered, the potential for pregnancy, adherence barriers, regimen convenience, and potential drug-food and drug-drug interactions. Resistance testing findings should also be considered in the initial regimen selection. Certain agents require consideration of other factors (eg, HLA-B*5701 testing for abacavir hypersensitivity, pretreatment CD4 count for nevirapine) before their use. [ 6]  Treatment endpoints Virologic endpoints for therapy include the following: One log 10  decline in HIV-1 RNA by 2-8 weeks Fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL by 16-24 weeks If one of these endpoints is not met, the patient should be evaluated to determine whether nonadherence, drug intolerance, or resistance is a factor. Alteration of therapy may be necessary based on the specific circumstances. [ 6]  Treatment-experienced patients Definition of treatment failure Although success with antiretroviral therapy has greatly improved with the introduction of more potent and well-tolerated medications, treatment failure remains an important challenge for clinicians. Failure of antiretroviral therapy is defined under the following circumstances [ 6]  : Virologic failure (suboptimal viral suppression or loss of suppression [>50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL]) Immunologic failure (failure to achieve or maintain CD4 cell count recovery despite effective viral suppression) Clinical disease progression (development of new opportunistic infections or neoplasms despite apparent CD4 count recovery) Treatment failure is often due to multiple factors. The identification of potential contributing factors is important so that corrective measures can be instituted to improve the likelihood of success with new therapy. Common factors that contribute to treatment failure include the following: Nonadherence Drug toxicity Potency of the antiretroviral regimen Drug-drug interactions leading to suboptimal drug concentrations Pre-existing drug resistance prior to institution of antiretroviral therapy Development of resistance Virologic failure is the most common reason for treatment failure. Virologic failure in the DHHS ART Guidelines is defined as incomplete virologic suppression or viral rebound, leading to inability to maintain viral suppression. [ 6]  Different definitions of virologic failure are applied depending on when the antiretroviral regimen was initiated, as follows: More than 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after 24 weeks More than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after 48 weeks Repeatedly detectable viremia after prior viral suppression (ie, < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) No consensus on the management of virologic failure exists. One approach is to change antiretroviral therapy when HIV-1 RNA is repeatedly detectable (>50 copies/mL on 2 consecutive measurements). A more conservative approach would be to change therapy once viremia exceeds some predefined level (eg, 1,000-5,000 copies/mL). A potential disadvantage to this approach is that additional resistance mutations may be selected during this period of viremia. The availability of other antiretroviral therapy options often dictates which approach should be taken. [ 6]  The identification and management of treatment failure due to immunologic failure is less clear. No standard definition for immunologic failure exists. In some instances, the inability to surpass predefined thresholds (CD4 count >350 cells/µL) over a specified period when CD4 counts are expected to plateau (4-7 y) has been labeled immunologic failure. In other instances, a lack of CD4 cell count increase from baseline (eg, 100 cells/µL) over a defined period has also been considered a failure. [ 6]  Risk factors associated with immunologic failure include the following: Low CD4 count (< 200 cells/µL) Comorbidities (eg, malignancy, viral coinfection) Older age NRTIs (zidovudine, tenofovir-didanosine) Other medications (eg, corticosteroids, chemotherapy, pegylated interferon) Ongoing immune activation Loss of immune system regenerative potential The implications for persistently impaired CD4 recovery in the individual patient need to be balanced with existing treatment options. Considerations include the following [ 6]  : Patients with CD4 cell counts that exceed 350-500 cells/µL are at a low risk for non–AIDS-related clinical events Patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 200 cells/µL are at greatest risk for both AIDS-related and non–AIDS-related events Replacement of individual antiretroviral components (eg, NNRTI to protease inhibitor) can be attempted provided that complete viral suppression is present, but this strategy remains unproven Addition of a single antiretroviral agent to the existing regimen has not been shown to be effective The use of immune stimulants (eg, interleukin-2, growth hormone) is presently recommended only in the context of a clinical trial Likewise, decisions to alter antiretroviral therapy in patients with disease progression are determined based on clinical severity and existing treatment options. Therapy selection Antiretroviral activity and durability improves with the addition of at least 2 or, optimally, 3 fully active agents to an optimized background regimen. The selection of individual agents for an optimized background regimen should be based on the antiretroviral treatment history, genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance results, drug-drug interaction potential, and medication intolerance, with the goal of maximizing antiviral activity and adherence. Divergence from the strategy of using 2 NRTIs with either an NNRTI or a protease inhibitor is typically necessary as the extent of drug resistance increases. Four to six drug regimens are commonly used in patients with extensive drug resistance in order to increase the degree of activity. [ 6]  The introduction of new antiretroviral agents has broadened the number of active agents available for treatment of patients with infection due to resistant HIV and has improved the success rate of therapy. Raltegravir, tipranavir, darunavir, enfuvirtide, maraviroc, and etravirine are frequently considered for use. Limited information exists regarding optimal combinations of these agents for treatment, as selection is often based on resistance testing results, prior treatment history, and intolerance. [ 6]  Enfuvirtide is highly effective in the treatment of antiretroviral therapy–experienced patients but requires subcutaneous injection twice daily and is associated with injection-site reactions. Darunavir and tipranavir typically retain activity in the presence of multiple protease inhibitor mutations. The use of tipranavir has been hindered by the potential for interaction with other antiretroviral agents, hepatotoxicity, and reports of intracranial bleeding events. Raltegravir has been demonstrated to be highly active in patients with extensive drug resistance in short-term studies (48 weeks) and is well-tolerated. Etravirine is most effective when combined with other active agents but may cause drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral agents. The role of maraviroc in this setting has been limited because of the high frequency of dual/mixed-tropic or CXCR4-tropic virus in patients with more long-standing HIV infection and the necessity for expensive tropism assay pretesting. Goals of therapy The goals of therapy in treatment-experienced patients are the same as in treatment-naive patients. [ 6]  With the introduction of newer agents, suppression of viremia to below the limit of assay detection (< 48 copies/mL) is now achievable in many patients who harbor drug-resistant viral strains. Genotypic or phenotypic resistance testing should be used to assist with selection of appropriate therapy and should be obtained while patients remain on their previous therapy or within 4 weeks of discontinuation to improve the sensitivity of results. Phenotypic testing is generally added to genotypic testing when complex drug resistance mutation patterns, especially to protease inhibitors, are confirmed or suspected. [ 6]  Virologic endpoints for therapy include the following: One log 10  decline in HIV-1 RNA by 8 weeks Fewer than 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL by 24 weeks Fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL by 48 weeks If one of these endpoints is not met, the patient should be evaluated to determine whether nonadherence, drug intolerance, or resistance is a factor. Special populations Pregnancy Antiretroviral therapy is recommended in all pregnant women with HIV infection regardless of viral load or CD4 count. Independent of viral load, antiretroviral therapy has been shown to decrease the likelihood of mother-to-child transmission. The goal of therapy is to achieve maximal virologic suppression to minimize the transmission risk. It is recommended that all women initiating therapy for the first time or those receiving therapy who have a detectable viral load undergo genotypic resistance testing to guide therapy selection. Preferred agents include the following: NRTI - Zidovudine, lamivudine NNRTI - Nevirapine Protease inhibitor (PI) - Lopinavir/ritonavir Antiretroviral therapy should consist of two NRTIs with either an NNRTI or PI, guided by resistance testing. Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine is preferred in most cases. Efavirenz is not recommended during the first trimester because of significant teratogenicity in primate studies and should be used during the second and third trimesters only if it offers clear benefit over other alternatives. A retrospective cohort study reviewed the records of 3,273 HIV-positive women receiving prenatal care in Malawi and Mozambique from July 2005 to December 2009. Patients were treated with triple antiviral therapy during pregnancy until 6 months postpartum for prevention of vertical transmission. Regardless of CD4 count, ART provided a protective effect against mortality, fetal demise, and premature birth. [ 86]  PI-based HAART is associated with increased preterm delivery (21.4% versus 11.8% with NRTI therapy) but not with increased infant hospitalizations or mortality. [ 87]  Caution should be used with nevirapine regimens owing to observed hepatic failure and death in a small number of patients. The risk for nevirapine-related toxicity is increased with CD4 counts above 250/µL in women; therefore, nevirapine should be used only in women with higher CD4 counts if the benefit outweighs the risk. The OCTANE study showed that ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus tenofovir–emtricitabine was superior to nevirapine plus tenofovir–emtricitabine for initial antiretroviral therapy in women with prior exposure to peripartum single-dose nevirapine (but not in those without prior exposure). [ 88]  Zidovudine should be included in all regimens unless its use is precluded by severe toxicity or documented resistance. Regardless of the antenatal regimen, zidovudine should be administered by intravenous infusion to the mother during labor and orally to the neonate for 6 weeks following birth. More detailed information regarding treatment of pregnant women with HIV infection is included in guidelines from the U.S. Public Health Service for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. [ 89]  Providers are encouraged to report all cases of perinatal antiretroviral exposure to the  Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry . Postexposure prophylaxis following occupational HIV exposures Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of HIV infection when administered soon after exposure. The risk for HIV infection is determined based on the exposure type (percutaneous, mucous membrane, intact skin), severity of exposure (small or large volume, superficial or deep injury), and source status (known or unknown HIV status). Postexposure prophylaxis is recommended for exposures from a documented HIV source and is considered optional when the HIV status of the source individual is unknown. For low-risk exposures (eg, mucous membrane), a 2-drug (basic) regimen is recommended. For high-risk exposures (eg, percutaneous needle stick), a 3-drug (expanded) regimen is recommended. Ideally, therapy should be started as soon as possible after exposure (within hours) and continued for 28 days. The following are the preferred basic regimens: Zidovudine plus lamivudine Zidovudine plus emtricitabine Tenofovir plus lamivudine Tenofovir plus emtricitabine The preferred expanded regimen is the basic regimen plus lopinavir/ritonavir. A consultation with an expert should be sought when antiretroviral therapy for postexposure prophylaxis is considered, especially when the antiretroviral treatment history of the source individual is known. Additional information on treatment selection and management can be found in the US Public Health guidelines for occupational HIV exposure. [ 90]  Postexposure prophylaxis following nonoccupational HIV exposures Nonoccupational exposure to HIV includes any exposure to potentially infectious bodily fluids and tissues not secondary to job duties. These exposures include but are not limited to sexual contact and the sharing of injection-drug equipment. Data from animal studies, perinatal transmission studies, experience with occupational post-exposure prophylaxis, and observational studies support the premise that initiation of a brief course of antiretroviral therapy after nonoccupational exposure may decrease the likelihood of HIV transmission. [ 91]  It is recommended that patients who present 72 hours or sooner after a substantial-risk HIV exposure involving an HIV-infected source be offered postexposure prophylaxis consisting of 3 antiretroviral agents. The risk is based on the type of exposure. If the HIV status of the source is unknown, each case should be determined individually based on risk. [ 91]  Substantial risk criteria include the following: Site of exposure - Vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucous membrane, nonintact skin, or percutaneous contact Infectious material - Blood, semen, vaginal secretions, rectal secretions, breast milk, or any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood Source status - Known HIV infection in the source Negligible risk criteria include the following: Site of exposure - Vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucous membrane, intact or nonintact skin, or percutaneous contact Infectious material - Urine, nasal secretions, saliva, sweat, or tears if not visibly contaminated with blood Source status - Regardless of the known or suspected HIV status of the source Postexposure prophylaxis is not recommended in patients who present more than 72 hours after exposure or who have exposures deemed to represent a negligible risk. If antiretroviral therapy is initiated, it should be continued for 28 days. [ 91]  The preferred regimens are as follows: Efavirenz plus lamivudine or emtricitabine plus zidovudine or tenofovir Lopinavir/ritonavir plus lamivudine or emtricitabine plus zidovudine Adolescents Adolescents with HIV infection represent a heterogenous patient population. This population includes newly infected patients and long-term survivors who were infected perinatally or through blood products. Adult treatment guidelines are usually appropriate in postpubertal adolescents. Similarly, patients infected with HIV via intravenous drug use or sexual encounters should be managed according to adult guidelines. Antiretroviral dosing should be based on the Tanner staging of puberty. Patients in stage I or II should receive medications according to pediatric schedules; those in late puberty (stage V) should undergo management according to adult guidelines. Few data provide guidance for dosing in adolescents who fall in stages III and IV. Close monitoring for efficacy and toxicity is imperative, regardless of the dosing schedule used to implement therapy. [ 6]  Patients with acute HIV infection Limited data are available to define the role of treatment in patients with acute HIV infection. The potential benefits of initiating treatment during acute infection remain theoretical. Treating acute infection may decrease the severity of acute disease, lower the level of chronic viremia following symptom resolution, decrease viral mutation, preserve immune function, and reduce transmission. If the patient and provider decide to implement treatment based on these potential benefits, combination therapy should be initiated similar to that administered in patients with chronic infection. It is recommended that protease inhibitor–based regimens be considered owing to the lower incidence of resistance to these agents in treatment-naïve patients. Providers may want to consider enrolling these patients into a clinical trial evaluating the natural history and the role of antiretroviral treatment in acute HIV infection. [ 6]  Coinfection A significant amount of morbidity and mortality in persons with HIV infection results from coinfection with  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (MTB), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Each of these infections is more difficult to manage in patients with HIV infection because of the accelerated rate of disease progression, lower treatment response rates, drug-drug interactions, and additive toxicities that result from concomitant therapies. Furthermore, HIV treatment is more imperative in the presence of coinfection, leading to initiation of antiretroviral therapy at higher CD4 counts than in patients with HIV monoinfection. The antiretroviral treatment sequencing strategy for each type of coinfection is challenging and must be tailored to individual patient-specific needs to provide the best possible outcome and to restore quality of life. Tuberculosis The overall rate of morbidity and mortality associated with  M tuberculosis  coinfection in patients with HIV infection is significant. Worldwide, estimates of the mortality rate due to  M tuberculosis  infection in the presence of HIV infection are 13%; however, such rates have significantly decreased in the United States because of the aggressive implementation of public health and hospital  M tuberculosis  programs. [ 92]  Nonetheless, significant overlap exists in the patient populations who are exposed to  M tuberculosis  and are at risk for HIV infection. Disease progression rates of each are accelerated with coinfection and require swift and aggressive management strategies. However, patients are not routinely screened for tuberculosis prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. A cohort study of HIV-infected patients identified risk factors for developing tuberculosis after HAART initiation in an effort to focus screening efforts. Results suggest patients with CD4 counts < 200 cells/µL or increased HIV-1 RNA, persons of nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity, and patients with a history of injection drug use should be targeted for tuberculosis screening. [ 93]  Current recommendations suggest that treatment for  M tuberculosis  infection and HIV infection be initiated separately because of additive adverse effects and overlapping toxicities; however, the ideal time frame between the two is less well-defined. [ 94]  Factors to consider with treatment sequencing for HIV and  M tuberculosis  coinfection include when to initiate each therapy and how to manage drug-drug interactions, adverse effects, and additive toxicities. In treatment-naïve patients, the focus of therapy should be directed initially toward  M tuberculosis  infection, but the implications for subsequent antiretroviral therapy must be considered in order to avoid or manage pending drug-drug interactions. Treatment selection for latent or active  M tuberculosis  infection is generally straightforward; however, significant drug-drug interactions are possible with antiretroviral medications when a rifamycin is included in the treatment plan because of their strong inductive effects on the cytochrome P450 system. [ 95]  Rifabutin  is usually selected over rifampin because of its less-potent metabolic induction when antiretroviral therapy is required, but dose adjustments are necessary when protease inhibitors and NNRTIs are administered concomitantly. Delaying antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naïve patients is controversial but necessary in order to assess potential side effects and toxicities (eg, gastrointestinal effect, hepatotoxicity) that are similar with each therapy. Current guidelines recommend a delay in antiretroviral therapy for 2-8 weeks after the initiation of  M tuberculosis  infection therapy, with consideration given to the potential consequences of antiretroviral therapy deferral in each patient. Several studies indicate that initiating HAART 2 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment significantly improves survival among HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T-cell counts of 200 per cubic millimeter or lower. Starting stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz after 2 weeks of tuberculosis treatment instead of 2 months improved mortality from 27% to 18% in one study with 661 patients. [ 96]  In another study, earlier HAART was associated with a lower rate of new AIDS-defining illness and death (27% vs 16%) in 881 patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter. [ 97]  A study with 642 ambulatory patients showed a decreased incidence rate of AIDS or death with 9 and 27 cases per 100 person-years in patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter (1 month vs 2.5 months). [ 98]  However, the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was significantly increased in the earlier HAART group (2.5% vs 3.6%). In patients currently receiving antiretroviral therapy,  M tuberculosis  infection therapy should be initiated as soon as possible, with similar consideration given to the potential for drug-drug interactions. Antiretroviral therapy recommendations for patients receiving treatment for  M tuberculosis  infection are discussed below. [ 6,  94]  For treatment-naïve (antiretroviral therapy initiation within the  M tuberculosis  infection treatment period), recommendations are as follows: Protease inhibitor–based regimen - Recommended to use ritonavir-boosted regimen NNRTI-based regimen - No dose adjustments required for efavirenz or nevirapine; limited data for etravirine Maraviroc-containing regimen - Potential for altered serum levels (dose determined by concomitant antiretroviral agents in the presence of rifabutin) For treatment-experienced (currently receiving antiretroviral therapy), recommendations are as follows for protease inhibitor–containing regimens: Unboosted - Change to ritonavir-boosted form Currently boosted - No dose adjustment required For treatment-experienced (currently receiving antiretroviral therapy), recommendations are as follows for NNRTI-containing regimens: Efavirenz or nevirapine - No dose adjustments required Etravirine - If not given concomitantly with boosted protease inhibitor, consider alternative Maraviroc - Limited data Hepatitis B virus infection Approximately 10% of individuals infected with HIV have HBV coinfection. [ 99]  Treatment for each disease can be challenging because of accelerated disease progression and lower treatment response rates for HBV infection and increased rates of hepatotoxicity with antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV and HBV coinfection often have higher HBV DNA, lower HBeAg seroconversion rates, and an increased risk of liver-related mortality. [ 100,  101,  102,  103]  Additionally, acute hepatic flares due to antiretroviral therapy are more likely in the presence of HBV owing to the compromised state of the liver and immune reconstitution reactions that can occur with treatment initiation at low CD4 counts. [ 101]  Nonetheless, overlapping therapies exist and are integrated into a treatment regimen that is optimal for both HIV infection and HBV infection. The goals of therapy for HIV and HBV coinfection reflect those of HIV and HBV monoinfection. The sequencing of therapy is patient-specific and is guided by criteria for each disease. Treatment for both can be successfully combined and should include NRTIs that possess activity against both viruses (tenofovir, lamivudine, emtricitabine). Most often, a 3-drug combination is recommended in patients with HIV and HBV coinfection when treatment is indicated for either disease in order to prevent the development of antiretroviral drug resistance. Both HIV and HBV can acquire resistance to the NRTIs, so therapy must be tailored to retain virologic control. If either virus acquires resistance, additional medications should be added to the current regimen rather than substituted in order to maintain virologic control of the remaining drug-susceptible virus. When HBV acquires resistance in the presence of HIV, other NRTIs that lack HIV activity ( adefovir ,  telbivudine ) can be added to the existing HBV regimen; however,  entecavir  should be used only in coinfected individuals with longstanding HIV RNA suppression because of its activity against HIV and the proposed risk of HIV drug resistance. In patients receiving HBV treatment without concomitant HIV therapy, pegylated interferon, adefovir, or telbivudine is recommended. Antiretroviral therapy recommendations in patients with HIV and HBV coinfection are discussed below. [ 101]  If only HIV treatment is required (and not HBV), recommendations are as follows: NRTI backbone should include tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine: Combination actively treats both HIV and HBV Third agent for HIV (patient- or provider-specific choice that minimizes hepatotoxicity potential) If only HBV treatment is required (and not HIV), recommendations are as follows: HBV DNA greater than 2000 IU/mL: Antiretroviral therapy must be initiated to prevent HIV resistance and should include tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine for the NRTI backbone HBV DNA less than 2000 IU/mL: Pegylated interferon alpha-2a 180 µg once weekly for 48 weeks, Adefovir, Telbivudine Hepatitis C virus infection Approximately 25% of persons with HIV infection are coinfected with HCV. [ 104,  105]  HCV infection in the presence of HIV infection progresses to cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease twice as quickly as in HCV monoinfection. [ 106]  Treatment outcomes, as measured by end-of-treatment response and sustained virologic response rates, are also lower in patients with HCV and HIV coinfection. [ 107,  108]  Although HIV disease progression has not been directly linked to HCV coinfection, it is significantly influenced by the lower rise in CD4 counts once antiretroviral therapy is initiated and the increased risk for hepatotoxicity with antiretroviral therapy. Drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy and standard HCV therapy have been demonstrated with the NRTIs and  ribavirin . Such interactions can produce significant toxicities and/or reduce the likelihood of response to HCV therapy. Sequencing of therapy usually begins with treatment of HIV infection; however, when a patient has not met treatment criteria or is unable to tolerate antiretroviral therapy, HCV treatment should be considered. Ideally, patients with HCV and HIV coinfection should have a CD4 count that exceeds 200/µL prior to HCV treatment initiation in order to improve tolerance and response to therapy; however, sufficient CD4 recovery is not within reach in some cases. [ 6,  101]  In these situations, HCV therapy should be initiated rather than delayed further because of the urgency to reduce HCV disease progression. [ 101]  Treatment options for HCV therapy are presently limited to combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Response rates are lower in coinfected patients, and extended treatment durations (eg, 48-72 weeks) are often recommended. [ 107,  108,  109]  Therapy for HIV consists of the standard 3-drug regimen, but drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and ribavirin and overlapping toxicities can further complicate treatment selection. Close monitoring of serum transaminases during combined antiretroviral therapy and HCV therapy is warranted because of the increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Drugs that interact or add toxicities with ribavirin include the NRTIs didanosine, zidovudine, and abacavir. The combination of didanosine and ribavirin is contraindicated owing to increased intracellular concentrations of didanosine that significantly increase the risk of life-threatening lactic acidosis and pancreatitis. [ 110]  Zidovudine and ribavirin can cause additive anemia and should be considered only in patients with a stable hemoglobin concentration. Lower HCV treatment response rates have been described in coinfected patients receiving abacavir-containing antiretroviral therapy regimens in 2 clinical trials. [ 111,  112]  When early virologic response rates and sustained virologic response rates were compared between abacavir-containing regimens and other nucleoside regimens, poorer outcomes reaching statistical significance were demonstrated in the abacavir group. Although the ribavirin and abacavir interaction has not been fully described, both are guanosine analogs and hypothesized to have competitive phosphorylation that can result in lower ribavirin concentrations. Tenofovir, on the other hand, has been shown to improve HCV treatment response rates when included in the antiretroviral therapy regimen and combined with ribavirin. [ 112]  Although guidelines for the use of abacavir and tenofovir in combination with HCV therapy have not been implemented, consideration should be given to these more recent findings. An abacavir-containing regimen should be avoided in coinfected patients who are candidates for HCV therapy until further data become available. Pre-exposure prophylaxis A multinational study, called the Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx) trial, found that once-daily emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF) reduced the risk of acquiring HIV by 44% in a study population of high-risk, HIV-negative men or transgender women who have sex with men. [ 113]  Currently, no data are available on the benefits of FTC-TDF in heterosexuals or injection drug users. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will determine how to most effectively use FTC-TDF in combination with other prevention strategies to reduce new HIV infections. The CDC, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other institutions are also conducting trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for these populations. [ 114,  115]  Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be part of comprehensive HIV prevention services in which HIV-negative people who are at high risk, take antiretroviral medication daily to try to lower their chances of becoming infected with HIV if they are exposed to it. PrEP consists of taking the combination drug, emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir 300 mg (Truvada), once daily. [ 116,  117]  Compliance is essential. In studies, the level of protection varied widely depending on how consistently participants used PrEP. Among those whose data (based on self-reports, bottles dispensed, and pill counts) indicate use on 90% or more days, HIV risk was reduced by 73%. Among those whose adherence by the same measure was less than 90%, HIV risk was reduced by only 21%. Comprehensive prevention services are also required (ie, monthly HIV testing, condom provision, counseling, and management of other sexually transmitted infections). To date, PrEP has been shown to be effective only in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgendered women who have sex with men. Studies are underway to evaluate whether PrEP is safe and effective in reducing HIV infection among heterosexual men and women as well as injection drug users, but those results are not yet available. HIV-discordant couples A  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  analysis of 7 observational studies found that ART is very potent for the prevention of HIV in couples in which only one partner is infected with the virus. Results show that in serodiscordant couples, uninfected partners of infected individuals being treated with antiretroviral drugs have a 5 times’ lower risk of contracting HIV compared to uninfected partners of infected individuals not receiving treatment. Whether to initiate ART in this population at the time of diagnosis or at a specific CD4 or plasma viral load level is unclear. A large, randomized controlled trial addressing this question is scheduled to conclude in 2015. [ 118]  A multicontinent, randomized, controlled trial by the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) in 2011 evaluated early versus delayed antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts between 350 and 550/µL who were in stable sexual relationships with noninfected partners. Findings show that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduced transmission rates of the disease by 96%. Early therapy was also associated with a 41% reduction in the number of HIV-related clinical events.

Pharmacokinetic Enhancers (Boosting Agents) Cobicistat  (Tybost) is a CYP3A inhibitor. As a single agent, it is indicated to increase systemic exposure of atazanavir or darunavir (once-daily dosing regimen) in combination with other antiretroviral agents. It is also a component of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Stribild). Cobicistat may be used for treatment-naïve or experienced patients (without darunavir resistance-associated substitutions). The dosage is 150 mg PO once daily plus atazanavir 300 mg PO once daily or darunavir 800 mg PO once daily. Ritonavir is also a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that is in many combination productions and included in many HIV treatment regimens to augment systemic exposure to other antiretroviral agents.

HIV disease is caused by infection with HIV-1 or HIV-2, which are retroviruses in the Retroviridae family,  Lentivirus  genus. See the image below.

Ewing, Jr.  Signs and symptoms The patient with HIV may present with signs and symptoms of any of the stages of HIV infection. No physical findings are specific to HIV infection; the physical findings are those of the presenting infection or illness. Manifestations include the following: Acute seroconversion manifests as a flulike illness, consisting of fever, malaise, and a generalized rash The asymptomatic phase is generally benign Generalized lymphadenopathy is common and may be a presenting symptom AIDS manifests as recurrent, severe, and occasionally life-threatening infections or opportunistic malignancies HIV infection can cause some sequelae, including AIDS-associated dementia/encephalopathy and HIV wasting syndrome (chronic diarrhea and weight loss with no identifiable cause) The history should address risk factors for possible exposure to HIV, including the following: Unprotected sexual intercourse, especially receptive anal intercourse A large number of sexual partners Previous or current sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Sharing of intravenous (IV) drug paraphernalia Receipt of blood products (before 1985 in the United States) Mucosal contact with infected blood or needle-stick injuries Maternal HIV infection (for newborns, infants, and children) See  Clinical Presentation  for more detail. Diagnosis HIV screening recommendations include the following: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians screen for HIV in all adolescents and adults at increased risk for HIV infection, and all pregnant women [ 1]  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends opt-out HIV screening for patients in all health-care settings; persons at high risk for HIV infection should be screened at least annually [ 2]  The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that clinicians adopt routine screening for HIV and encourage all patients to be tested [ 3]  A high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) should be used for screening; a positive result should be followed with confirmatory testing (eg, Western blot assays or similar specific assay); HIV-2 should be tested for in patients from an HIV-2 endemic area or those with indeterminate results on HIV-1 Western blot testing; early detection using combination screens may be more effective than simply using serology The CD4 T-cell count reliably reflects the current risk of acquiring opportunistic infections, as follows: Reference range, 500-2000 cells/μL Because CD4 counts vary, serial counts are generally a better measure of significant changes After seroconversion, CD4 counts tend to decrease (~700/μL) and continue to decline over time For surveillance, a CD4 count below 200/μL is considered AIDS-defining in the United States In children younger than 5 years, the CD4 T-cell percentage is considered more important than the absolute count (< 25% is considered to warrant therapy) In adults with chronic hepatitis C and low absolute CD4 T-cells, the CD4 percentage may also be more useful [ 4]  Viral load in peripheral blood is used as a surrogate marker of viral replication rate; however, quantitative viral-load assays should not be used as a diagnostic tool. Clinical relevance is as follows: Rate of progression to AIDS and death is related to the viral load; patients with viral loads greater than 30,000/μL are 18.5 times more likely to die of AIDS than those with undetectable viral loads. With therapy, viral loads can often be suppressed to an undetectable level (< 20-75 copies/mL; optimal viral suppression); complete inhibition of viral replication appears impossible and may be unnecessary Successfully treated patients may demonstrate intermittent low-level viremia (eg, < 400 copies/mL), but this is not thought to represent viral replication or to predict virologic failure (defined as a confirmed viral load of > 200 copies/mL [ 5]  In August 2013, the FDA approved Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo test (Orgenics, Ltd) as the first rapid HIV test for the simultaneous detection of HIV-1 p24 antigen as well as antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in human serum, plasma, and venous or fingerstick whole blood specimens. [ 6,  7]  The test does not distinguish between antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2, and is not intended to be used for screening of blood donors. [ 6,  7]  Baseline studies for other infections that are important in the initial workup of a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection include the following: Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin testing for tuberculosis Cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing Syphilis testing Rapid amplification testing for gonococcal and chlamydial infection Hepatitis A, B, and C serology Anti- Toxoplasma  antibody Ophthalmologic examination The CDC classifies HIV infection into 3 categories, as follows [ 8]  : Category A: Asymptomatic HIV infection without a history of symptoms or AIDS-defining conditions Category B: HIV infection with symptoms that are directly attributable to HIV infection (or a defect in T-cell–mediated immunity) or that are complicated by HIV infection Category C: HIV infection with AIDS-defining opportunistic infections These 3 categories are further subdivided on the basis of the CD4 +  T-cell count, as follows: > 500/µL: Categories A1, B1, C1 200-400/µL: Categories A2, B2, C2 < 200/µL: Categories A3, B3, C3 See  Workup  for more detail. Management Current Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines on the timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy are as follows [ 5]  : Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated in all patients with a history of an AIDS-defining illness or with a CD4 count below 350/µL Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated regardless of CD4 count in pregnant patients, patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, and those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection when treatment of HBV infection is indicated Panel divided on initiation of therapy with CD4 counts of 350-500/µL; 55% considered this a strong recommendation, 45% considered it a moderate recommendation Panel also divided on initiation of therapy with CD4 counts above 500/µL: half favored initiation in this setting, and half considered treatment initiation optional Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the principal method for preventing immune deterioration. Classes of antiretroviral agents include the following: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Fusion inhibitors CCR5 co-receptor antagonists (entry inhibitors) HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors Current DHHS guidelines list the following regimens as preferred in treatment-naive patients [ 5]  : INSTI-based regimens are as follows: \t\t Dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) - only for patients who are HLA-B*5701–negative DTG plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) Elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) - only for patients with pre-ART creatinine clearance (CrCl) of >70 mL/min Raltegravir (RAL) plus TDF/FTC The PI/r-based regimen is darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) plus TDF/FTC HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to NNRTIs and enfuvirtide. Regimen selection is individualized on the basis of the following [ 5]  : Virologic efficacy Toxicity Pill burden Dosing frequency Drug-drug interaction potential Drug resistance testing results Comorbid conditions In particular cases, prophylaxis is indicated for specific opportunistic infections, including the following: Pneumocystis jiroveci Toxoplasma Mycobacterium avium  complex Fungal and viral infections: Although prophylaxis for these infections is not routinely necessary, some recommend fluconazole in patients with CD4 +  T-cell counts under 50/µL to prevent candidal or cryptococcal infections and to protect against endemic fungal infections; oral ganciclovir is indicated for CMV prophylaxis in patients with advanced AIDS Additional treatment measures include the following: Treatment of opportunistic infections (directed at the specific pathogen) Treatment of  HIV lipodystrophy  (tesamorelin) Suppressive therapy for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection (acyclovir) Treatment of HIV-associated diarrhea (crofelemer [ 9]  ) The CDC has recommended basic and expanded HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. An overview of these recommendations is as follows: Basic PEP 2-drug regimen: Tenofovir plus emtricitabine (preferred); alternatives include zidovudine plus lamivudine, zidovudine plus emtricitabine, or tenofovir plus lamivudine Alternative basic PEP regimen: Lamivudine plus stavudine, lamivudine plus didanosine, emtricitabine plus stavudine, or emtricitabine plus didanosine Expanded PEP regimen: Basic PEP regimen plus raltegravir (preferred) or lopinavir-ritonavir An alternative expanded PEP regimen includes the basic PEP regimen plus one of the following: Atazanavir with or without ritonavir Fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir Indinavir with or without ritonavir Saquinavir with or without ritonavir Nelfinavir Efavirenz See  Treatment  and  Medication  for more detail. Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a blood-borne, sexually transmissible virus (see the image below.)

Electron microscopy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 virions. Courtesy of CDC/Dr. Edwin P... Electron microscopy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 virions. Courtesy of CDC/Dr. Edwin P. Ewing, Jr.  The most common route of infection varies from country to country and even among cities, reflecting the population in which HIV was introduced initially and local practices. Co-infection with other viruses that share similar routes of transmission, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8; also known as Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus [KSHV]), is common. Two distinct species of HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) have been identified, and each is composed of multiple subtypes, or clades. All clades of HIV-1 tend to cause similar disease, but the global distribution of the clades differs. This may have implications on any future vaccine, as the B clade, which is predominant in the developed world (where the large pharmaceutical companies are located), is rarely found in the developing countries that are more severely affected by the disease. HIV-1 probably originated from one or more cross-species transfers from chimpanzees in central Africa. [ 10]  HIV-2 is closely related to viruses that infect sooty mangabeys in western Africa. [ 11]  Genetically, HIV-1 and HIV-2 are superficially similar, but each contains unique genes and its own distinct replication process. HIV-2 carries a slightly lower risk of transmission, and HIV-2 infection tends to progress more slowly to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This may be due to a less-aggressive infection rather than a specific property of the virus itself. Persons infected with HIV-2 tend to have a lower viral load than people with HIV-1, [ 12,  13]  and a greater viral load is associated with more rapid progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infections. [ 14,  15]  HIV-2 is rare in the developed world. Consequently, most of the research and vaccine and drug development has been (perhaps unfairly) focused on HIV-1. For information on HIV infection in children, see  Pediatric HIV . Initial description and early spread In the United States, HIV disease was first described in 1981 among 2 groups, one in San Francisco and the other in New York City. Numerous young homosexual men presented with opportunistic infections that, at the time, were typically associated with severe immune deficiency:  Pneumocystis  pneumonia  (PCP) and aggressive  Kaposi sarcoma . [ 16]  HIV itself was not identified for another 2 years. [ 17]  During that time, various other causes were considered, including lifestyle factors, chronic drug abuse, and other infectious agents. [ 18]  The HIV epidemic spread rapidly and silently in the absence of testing. However, clear clinical implications arose before society became aware of the disease; for example, prior to the recognition of HIV, only one case of  Pneumocystis  pneumonia not clearly associated with immune suppression was diagnosed in the United States between January 1976 and June 1980. In 1981 alone, 42 similar diagnoses were made, and by December 1994, 127,626 cases of  Pneumocystis  pneumonia with HIV infection as the only identified cause of immune suppression had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Also, Kaposi sarcoma is up to 30,000 times more likely to develop in persons with HIV infection than in immunocompetent persons. The spread of HIV was retrospectively shown to follow the trucking routes across Africa from logging camps, and the bush-meat trade combined with aggressive logging and improved transportation in the mid-20th century may have allowed what was likely occasional cross-species transmission events to propagate across the country and, eventually, the globe. [ 19]  Stigma of HIV infection A considerable amount of stigma has been attached to HIV infection, mostly because of the virus's association with sexual acquisition and the inference of sexual promiscuity. Consequences of this stigma have included discrimination and reluctance to be tested for HIV infection. The stigma of HIV infection is also associated with a fear of acquiring a rapidly fatal infection from relatively casual contact. Such attitudes are inappropriate because HIV is poorly transmissible without sexual contact or blood contact. In addition, the expected survival is long in patients with HIV infection who are receiving treatment. HIV is not transmitted during casual contact and is readily inactivated by simple detergents. Much of the concern regarding HIV infection is due to the incurability of the infection and the relentless immune decline and eventual premature death in the vast majority of infected people. AIDS denialism A small but vocal minority of people, including some scientists, continue to argue that HIV does not exist, or does not cause AIDS, and that the HIV tests are unreliable or that the therapies are toxic. Such misinformation is usually based on a lack of understanding of the scientific literature, deliberate misrepresentation, or logical fallacies based on pseudoscientific arguments. All of the arguments proposed by these dissenters have been addressed and rebutted in the scientific literature and public discussion and even tested and rejected in the legal system. Nevertheless, they persist, and such views can have extremely harmful effects on people who are exposed to HIV infection unnecessarily or who refuse treatment for their progressing infection. Clinicians should be aware of these issues, should be able and willing to address misinformation, and should direct their patients to reliable sources of information. Political denial and inaction have also likely caused considerable damage. Several governments in countries with high HIV infection rates were slow to admit that they had an HIV epidemic, and at least one (South Africa) initially rejected that AIDS was even a problem, then that the disease was caused by HIV infection, and, most recently, that antiretroviral therapy was effective in treating HIV infection and preventing MTCT. Changes have now occurred but have been slow and have cost hundreds of thousands of lives. A regularly updated reference for addressing AIDS denial and misinformation can be found at  AIDSTruth.org . The quest for understanding of HIV Since the discovery of HIV and its link to AIDS, great strides have been made in understanding its biology and in developing effective treatments. The difficulty in dealing with HIV on a global scale is largely due to the fact that HIV infection is far more common in resource-poor countries. In the developed world, antiretroviral therapy has greatly improved prognosis and increased survival rates. Public education programs have raised awareness such that testing and prevention of infection are more common. Both of these approaches are difficult in countries with undereducated or underfunded populations. A thorough discussion of the history of AIDS and the biologic link between HIV and AIDS can be found in an article entitled \"  The relationship between the human immunodeficiency virus and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  \" at the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  Web site. The document was originally written in September 1995, prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which has significantly improved AIDS-free survival in persons infected with HIV. This version was updated March 2010. Patient confidentiality HIV-related health information is typically considered separate from other health information and may require separate consent to share or divulge. Health care workers who are infected with HIV may be required to divulge their status to their employer or patients and may be restricted in the types of procedures they can perform. Pathophysiology HIV produces cellular immune deficiency characterized by the depletion of helper T lymphocytes (CD4 +  cells). The loss of CD4 +  cells results in the development of opportunistic infections and neoplastic processes. Virology of HIV HIV-1 and HIV-2 are retroviruses in the Retroviridae family,  Lentivirus  genus. They are enveloped, diploid, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a DNA intermediate, which is an integrated viral genome (a provirus) that persists within the host-cell DNA. HIV contains 3 species-defining retroviral genes:  gag ,  pol , and  env . The  gag  gene encodes group-specific antigen; the inner structural proteins. The  pol  gene encodes polymerase; it also contains integrase and protease (the viral enzymes) and is produced as a C-terminal extension of the Gag protein). The  env  gene encodes the viral envelope—the outer structural proteins responsible for cell-type specificity. Glycoprotein 120, the viral-envelope protein, binds to the host CD4 +  molecule. HIV-1 has 6 additional accessory genes:  tat, rev, nef, vif, vpu,  and  vpr . HIV-2 does not have  vpu  but instead has the unique gene  vpx.  The only other virus known to contain the  vpu  gene is simian immunodeficiency virus in chimpanzees (SIV cpz ), which is the simian equivalent of HIV. [ 10]  Interestingly, chimpanzees with active HIV-1 infection are resistant to disease. [ 20]  The accessory proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 are involved in viral replication and may play a role in the disease process. [ 21,  22]  The outer part of the genome consists of long terminal repeats (LTRs) that contain sequences necessary for gene transcription and splicing, viral packaging of genomic RNA, and dimerization sequences to ensure that 2 RNA genomes are packaged. (See the image below.) Genome layout of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 and HIV-2.  Genome layout of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 and HIV-2.  The dimerization, packaging, and gene-transcription processes are intimately linked; disruption in one process often subsequently affects another. The LTRs exist only in the proviral DNA genome; the viral RNA genome contains only part of each LTR, and the complete LTRs are re-created during the reverse-transcription process prior to integration into the host DNA. The biologic basis for AIDS The specific details of the disease process that leads to AIDS are not fully understood despite considerable progress in the virology of HIV and the immunology of the human host, much of which has been driven by the urge to better understand AIDS. [ 23,  24,  25]  There is a specific decline in the CD4 +  helper T cells, resulting in inversion of the normal CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio and dysregulation of B-cell antibody production. [ 26,  27]  Immune responses to certain antigens begin to decline, and the host fails to adequately respond to opportunistic infections and normally harmless commensal organisms. Because the defect preferentially affects cellular immunity, the infections tend to be nonbacterial (fungal, viral). The pattern of opportunistic infections in a geographic region reflects the pathogens that are common in that area. For example, persons with AIDS in the United States tend to present with commensal organisms such as  Pneumocystis  and  Candida  species, homosexual men are more likely to develop Kaposi sarcoma because of co-infection with HHV8, and  tuberculosis  is common in developing countries. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) plays a role in HIV replication. [ 28]  Although the portal of entry for HIV infection is typically through direct blood inoculation or exposure of the virus to genital mucosal surfaces, the GI tract contains a large amount of lymphoid tissue, making this an ideal site for HIV replication. GALT has been shown to be a site of early viral seeding and establishment of the proviral reservoir. This reservoir contributes to the difficulty of controlling the infection, and efforts to reduce the levels of HIV provirus through sustained antiretroviral therapy (alone or in combination with interleukin-2 activation of resting HIV-infected T cells) have consistently failed. [ 29]  A feature of HIV replication in GALT is that it is compartmentalized, even among different areas of the gut. [ 30]  Measurements of CD4 +  T cells in GALT show relatively less reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy than that observed in peripheral blood. [ 31,  32]  At least one report has suggested that early treatment may result in better GALT CD4 +  T-cell recovery, [ 32]  but clinical data generally argue against early initiation of therapy, which has not been shown to improve long-term survival. In addition, HIV replication can be detected even in patients with supposedly suppressed replication, as judged by plasma viral load measurements. CD8 +  killer T-cell responses to HIV occur in GALT and do not decline with antiviral therapy as much as peripheral measurements do. [ 33]  These findings underscore the limitations of peripheral measurements in what is really a central viral replication. One theory for the discrepancy between GALT and blood measurements is that ongoing viral replication in the lymphoid tissue, and the resulting immune activation, may actually hamper efficient CD4 +  T-cell replenishment. [ 34]  Studies of T-cell–replication kinetics have revealed that untreated HIV infection is characterized by rapid T-cell turnover but a defect in T-cell replication from the thymus. [ 35,  36,  37]  These changes can be reversed with effective long-term antiviral therapy, [ 38,  39]  suggesting that they are due to a direct effect of the virus or are a feature of the immune response against HIV. It is known that normal cell cycling is necessary to produce a normal cytokine profile [ 40]  and that HIV causes cell-cycle arrest. [ 41]  Whether this is the exact mechanism is unresolved, however. Analysis of cytokine levels in HIV infected, uninfected, and HAART-treated patients with HIV show that cytokines involved in T-cell homeostasis were definitely affected, and therapy partially corrected these defects. In particular there was decreased IL-7, IL-12, IL-15 and FGF-2, and increased TNF-alpha and IP-10. [ 42,  43]  Several of the HIV proteins directly affect T-cell function, either by disrupting cell cycling or down-regulating the CD4 molecule. The loss of T cells is clearly a primary issue, as the T-cell repertoire narrows in terms of which antigens the immune system will recognize and respond to. Antiviral therapy is able to reverse these changes, [ 44]  but the degree of reversal is decreased if therapy is initiated very late in the infection and is further decreased when therapy is initiated when CD4 T-cell counts are 200/µL and below. Direct cytotoxic effects of viral replication are likely not the primary cause of CD4 T-cell loss; a significant bystander effect [ 45]  is likely secondary to T-cell apoptosis as part of immune hyperactivation in response to the chronic infection. Infected cells may also be affected by the immune attack. One interesting issue is that the co-receptor usage of the virus strains tends to change over time. The initial infection nearly always involves a strain that uses the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), which is found on macrophages and dendritic cells, as a co-receptor with CD4. People who are homozygous for deletions in the  CCR5  gene (ie, CCR5-delta32) tend to be resistant to infection, [ 46,  47]  and those with heterozygosity for the polymorphism tend to show slower progression of disease. [ 48]  Over time, the receptor usage shifts to chemokine-related receptor (CXCR4) and other related receptors found on CD4 +  T cells. These virus strains are more likely to cause cell fusion (syncytia formation). This trend is far from absolute but does correlate in many people with disease progression. [ 49]  A single case report detailed a possible cure resulting from stem-cell transplantation from a CCR5-delta32 homozygous donor (performed to treat acute myelocytic leukemia). Although this important finding is unlikely to impact routine management of HIV infection, it does suggest that reconstitution of a host immune system with a population of mutant cells is a possible avenue of research to explore. [ 50]  Regardless of the cause for the disruption, a loss of thymic replacements in the face of an induced state of immune activation and T-cell loss seems to be a key component of the mechanism by which HIV narrows the T-cell repertoire and progresses to AIDS. [ 51,  52,  53]  Visible effects of HIV infection come in the form of disrupted lymph-node architecture. This disruption is temporal, and, at one point, lymph-node biopsy was considered as a form of staging the disease. [ 54,  55]  The disruption of the follicular dendritic network in the lymph nodes and subsequent failure of normal antigen presentation are likely contributors to the disease process. HIV replicates in activated T cells (its promotor contains a nuclear factor kappa B [NF-kappa-B]–binding region, the same protein that promotes other proteins in activated T cells and macrophages), and activated T cells migrate to the lymph nodes. As such, much of the viral replication occurs outside of the peripheral blood, even though serum viral load is still a useful surrogate marker of viral replication. As mentioned above, with regards to GALT, HIV infection may be compartmentalized; specifically, areas of immune-privilege may occur such as in the testes and central nervous system where not only will there be differences in HIV pseudospecies but also different degrees of antiretroviral drug penetration. There is evidence that even with good peripheral control of HIV, the virus may still be detectable in the CSF and semen of some infected patients. [ 56,  57]  Phases of HIV infection Clinical HIV infection undergoes 3 distinct phases: acute seroconversion, asymptomatic infection, and AIDS. Each is discussed below. (See the image below.) Timeline of CD4 T-cell and viral-load changes over time in untreated human immunodeficiency... Timeline of CD4 T-cell and viral-load changes over time in untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. From Wikipedia, based on an original from Pantaleo et al (1993).  Acute seroconversion Animal models show that Langerhans cells are the first cellular targets of HIV, which fuse with CD4 +  lymphocytes and spread into deeper tissues. In humans, rapid occurrence of plasma viremia with widespread dissemination of the virus is observed 4-11 days after mucosal entrance of the virus. There is no fixed site of integration, but the virus tends to integrate in areas of active transcription, probably because these areas have more open chromatin and more easily accessible DNA. [ 58,  59]  This greatly complicates eradication of the virus by the host, as latent proviral genomes can persist without being detected by the immune system and cannot be targeted by antivirals. See the image below. During this phase, the infection is established and a proviral reservoir is created. [ 60,  61]  This reservoir consists of persistently infected cells, typically macrophages, and appears to steadily release virus. Some of the viral release replenishes the reservoir, and some goes on to produce more active infection. The proviral reservoir, as measured by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), seems to be incredibly stable. Although it does decline with aggressive antiviral therapy, the half-life is such that eradication is not a viable expectation. The size of the proviral reservoir correlates to the steady-state viral load and is inversely correlated to the anti-HIV CD8 +  T-cell responses. Aggressive early treatment of acute infection may lower the proviral load, but generally, treatment in newly infected (but postseroconversion) patients yields no long-term benefit. At this point, the viral load is typically very high, and the CD4 +  T-cell count drops precipitously. With the appearance of anti-HIV antibodies and CD8 +  T-cell responses, the viral load drops to a steady state and the CD4 +  T-cell count returns to levels within the reference range, although slightly lower than before infection. Seroconversion may take a few weeks, up to several months. Symptoms during this time may include fever, flulike illness, lymphadenopathy, and rash. These manifestations develop in approximately half of all people infected with HIV. Asymptomatic HIV infection At this stage in the infection, persons infected with HIV exhibit few or no signs or symptoms for a few years to a decade or more. Viral replication is clearly ongoing during this time, [ 62]  and the immune response against the virus is effective and vigorous. In some patients, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy is an outward sign of infection. During this time, the viral load, if untreated, tends to persist at a relatively steady state, but the CD4 +  T-cell count steadily declines. This rate of decline is related to, but not easily predicted by, the steady-state viral load. No firm evidence has shown that the initiation of therapy early in the asymptomatic period is effective. However, very late initiation is known to result in a less effective response to therapy and a lower level of immune reconstitution. AIDS When the immune system is damaged enough that significant opportunistic infections begin to develop, the person is considered to have AIDS. For surveillance purposes in the United States, a CD4 +  T-cell count less than 200/µL is also used as a measure to diagnose AIDS, although some opportunistic infections develop when CD4 +  T-cell counts are higher than 200/µL, and some people with CD4 counts under 200/µL may remain relatively healthy. Many opportunistic infections and conditions are used to mark when HIV infection has progressed to AIDS. The general frequency of these infections and conditions varies from rare to common, but all are uncommon or mild in immunocompetent persons. When one of these is unusually severe or frequent in a person infected with HIV and no other causes for immune suppression can be found, AIDS can be diagnosed. [ 8]  Immunologic control of HIV The primary mechanism for immunologic control of HIV appears to be CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. T-cell responses are correlated with the steady-state viral load and hence, the rate of progression. [ 63]  Cellular immunity is apparently responsible for some multiply-exposed, but uninfected individuals. [ 64,  65]  Although antibodies against HIV can be detected, it is clear that they are not sufficiently neutralizing to assist with immunologic control of the infection. The role of NK (Natural Killer) cells may be important in the initial control of HIV. Escape mutations have been detected, implying that immunologic pressure on HIV exists from NK cells. [ 66]  Opportunistic infections and conditions Even after starting therapy and with effective suppression of viral load, patients with persistently low CD4 counts remain at high risk for opportunistic infections. In general, all patients remain at a relatively high risk for opportunistic infections and other AIDS-related events for the first 6 months of antiretroviral therapy. [ 67]  An observational study of 20,730 HIV patients in Uganda found that, among patients with more than six months of follow-up after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, the pre-therapy CD4 count was still predictive of mortality. [ 68]  Opportunistic infections and conditions include the following (  *  added in the 1993 AIDS surveillance case definition): Candidiasis of bronchi, trachea, or lungs Candidiasis, esophageal Cervical cancer, invasive* Coccidioidomycosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary Cryptosporidiosis, chronic intestinal (duration >1 mo) Cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen, or nodes) Cytomegalovirus retinitis (with vision loss) Encephalopathy, HIV-related Herpes simplex: chronic ulcer or ulcers (duration >1 mo) or bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis Histoplasmosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal (duration >1 mo) Kaposi sarcoma Lymphoma, Burkitt (or equivalent term) Lymphoma, immunoblastic (or equivalent term) Lymphoma, primary, of the brain Mycobacterium avium  complex or  Mycobacterium kansasii  infection, disseminated or extrapulmonary M tuberculosis  infection, any site (pulmonary* or extrapulmonary) Mycobacterium  infection with other species or unidentified species, disseminated or extrapulmonary Pneumocystis  pneumonia Pneumonia, recurrent* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Salmonella  septicemia, recurrent Toxoplasmosis of the brain Wasting syndrome due to HIV infection Although malaria is not typically considered an opportunistic infection, its incidence was found to be significantly higher among children in Tanzania that were perinatally infected with HIV than those without HIV infection. [ 69]  This was true for physician-diagnosed clinical malaria, probable malaria involving laboratory testing for parasitemia as well as malaria that was confirmed by blood smear. There also appears to be an increased rate of anal cancer in high-risk groups (in particular, men who have sex with men). This is unsurprising considering the link between anal cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV), and the fact that cervical cancer, also caused by HPV, is considered an AIDS-defining condition. [ 70]  HIV Encephalopathy is a severe condition usually seen in end-stage disease. Milder cognitive impairments may exist with less advanced disease. For example, one study found significant deficits in cognition, planning, coordination and reaction times in HIV-infected compared to uninfected children, effects that were more pronounced in those with higher viral loads. [ 71]  Etiology HIV disease is caused by infection with HIV-1 or HIV-2, both of which cause very similar conditions. They differ in transmission and progression risks. Epidemiology United States statistics According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2009 the estimated rate of diagnoses of HIV infection in the 40 states that have confidential name-based reporting was 17.4 per 100,000 population. From 2006 to 2009, the estimated number and rate of annual diagnoses of HIV infection in those states remained stable. [ 72]  The CDC estimated that at the end of 2006, the most recent year for which national prevalence estimates are available, there were 1,106,400 adults and adolescents living with HIV infection in the United States. This represents an increase of approximately 11% from the previous estimate in 2003; the increase may reflect a higher proportion of HIV-infected people knowing their status and seeking care, and/or increased survival among people infected with HIV. [ 72]  In 2009, the estimated rate of AIDS diagnoses in the US was 11.2 per 100,000 population. [ 72]  More than 1 million persons were diagnosed with AIDS from 1981 to 2008, and more than 600,000 people died with AIDS (although reporting limitations mean that not every \"death with AIDS\" is directly attributable to AIDS itself). US rates vary by state. See the latest  CDC surveillance report  for full details. The overall figures may give a false impression that the HIV epidemic is relatively homogeneous. In fact, the HIV epidemic is best viewed as numerous separate epidemics among distinct risk groups, although the various epidemics clearly have some level of overlap. In any given area, the infection may be most prevalent among users of intravenous drugs who share needles. In another, the main risk group may be men who have sex with other men. And in yet another, the main risk group may be female sex workers. These sub-epidemics each follow their own pattern, although there is some degree of interdependence. Early on, nearly all cases of HIV infection detected in the Western Hemisphere were in homosexual men, but the spread of the disease to female partners of bisexual men with HIV infection gave rise to an increased rate among heterosexual persons. Contributing to the increased cross-prevalence were persons with hemophilia who had been infected with HIV from contaminated factor VIII concentrate and persons who used intravenous drugs, an activity that transcends all sexual preferences. Currently, less than half of new HIV infections are reported in homosexual men, and infected heterosexual women outnumber infected heterosexual men nearly two to one. [ 72]  (See the image below.) Incidence of HIV infection by risk group. From the CDC Web site (copyright free) derived from... Incidence of HIV infection by risk group. From the CDC Web site (copyright free) derived from the revised 2006 estimated figures.  One community-based study targeting areas where men who have sex with men (MSM) meet demonstrated that an average of 44% of study participants appeared unaware of their HIV-positive status. High rates of positivity and unawareness of positive status were associated with younger participants, men of black non-Hispanic race, and lower education levels. Healthcare visits in the preceding year were associated with a lower rate of unawareness (37% vs 81%) but a higher rate of HIV-positivity (21% vs 12%). Because this study targeted a high-risk group and may involve participation bias, the overall rate of HIV infection (19%) cannot be easily extrapolated to the overall population. [ 73]  Mortality from HIV disease has not been among the 15 leading causes of death in the US since 1997. The age-adjusted death rate for HIV disease peaked in 1995 at 16.3 per 100,000 population, decreased 69.9% through 1998, then further decreased 30.2% from 1999 through 2007, to 3.7 per 100,000 population. In 2007, a total of 11,295 persons died from HIV disease. However, HIV disease has remained among the 5 leading causes of death for specific age groups for females, and in the black population. [ 74]  Adolescents and young adults CDC HIV surveillance statistics from 2010 report that 25.7% (~12,200 individuals) of new HIV infections in the United States are in adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 24 years. Males accounted for 82.8% of new HIV infections in youth. Of these, 7000 (57.4%) were in African Americans, 2390 (19.6%) in Hispanics, and 2380 (19.5%) in whites. Male-to-male sexual contact accounted for 72.1% (8800 individuals). The percentage of youths tested for HIV infection was 12.9% in high- school students and 34.5% in individuals aged 18-24 years. Testing was lower in males than females. More than half (59.5%) of youths with HIV are unaware of their infection. [ 75]  International statistics According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), [ 76]  worldwide in 2008 approximately 33.4 million people (1% of the global adult population aged 15-49 y) were infected with HIV, a decline from 2006 (39.5 million reported at that time). UNAIDS estimates that 2.7 million people were newly infected with HIV and that 2 million people died from AIDS in 2008, both statistics showing a slight decline over time. The vast majority of infections remain in sub-Saharan Africa, where 5.2% of the population is thought to be infected. Between 2004 and 2006, the prevalence of HIV infection in central and eastern Asia and Eastern Europe increased by 21%. During this period, the number of new HIV infections in persons aged 15 to 64 years rose by 70% in Eastern Europe and central Asia. The infection rates in many developed countries remain stable, and some developing countries have achieved significant gains in controlling and even reversing the effects of the HIV epidemic. However, this is partially due to deaths in HIV-infected people, together with simultaneous prevention of new infections. India, for example, has used a national prevention campaign focusing on high-risk populations that may have prevented 100,000 new HIV infections over the 5 years it has been implemented, with increasing results seen in areas with higher levels of investment. [ 77]  These figures together show that global HIV infection is in a state of flux. The mortality rate in some countries has greatly increased. In South Africa (a country that, despite having a relatively late-onset HIV epidemic, has developed one of the highest prevalence rates), the all-cause HIV-associated mortality rate increased by 79% between 1997 and 2004. In women aged 25-34 years, mortality rates increased by 500% during this period. Swaziland has the highest overall prevalence of HIV infection (>26% of all adults based on 2007 figures). The Ministry of Health in Zambia predicts that, without therapy and assuming current levels of prevalence, young adults have a 50% lifetime risk of dying from AIDS. In developing nations, co-infection with HIV and tuberculosis is very common. The immunosuppressed state induced by HIV infection contributes not only to a higher rate of tuberculosis reactivation but also to an increased disease severity, as with many other opportunistic infections. Further details of the global epidemic can be found in the  Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 2009 Epidemic Update. Racial, sexual, and age-related differences in incidence In the United States, the rate of HIV infection is highest in blacks (83.7 cases per 100,000 population). The prevalence is also high among Hispanic persons (29.3 per 100,000 population). These increased rates are due to socioeconomic factors rather than genetic predisposition. In the developed world, HIV infection is much more common in males. In 2009, males accounted for 76% of all diagnoses of HIV infection among adults and adolescents in the US. [ 72]  Among heterosexuals, females are more likely to acquire HIV infection from an infected male than a male is from an infected female, but a large proportion of infections in males are due to homosexual contact, with or without injection drug use. Males are also more likely to acquire HIV infection from injection drug use alone. Males were also more likely to acquire HIV infection through contaminated blood products for treatment of hemophilia before universal testing of the blood supply was instituted. The risk of HIV exposure from factor VIII concentrates has been virtually eliminated by viricidal treatment of plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates, as well as the introduction of recombinant factor VIII concentrates and the gradual elimination of albumin from the production process used for these products. In the developing world, HIV infection is equally common in males and females. The primary route of HIV transmission in the developing world is heterosexual contact. Young adults tend to be at higher risk of acquiring HIV, typically through high-risk activities such as unprotected sexual intercourse or intravenous drug use. In 2009 in the US, the largest percentage (15% of all diagnoses) and the highest rate (36.9 per 100,000 population) were in persons aged 20–24 years. [ 72]  Children may become infected by transplacental transmission or by breastfeeding. Rare cases of children infected after sexual abuse by HIV-infected adults have also been reported. Prognosis The prognosis in patients with untreated HIV infection is poor, with an overall mortality rate of more than 90%. The average time from infection to death is 8-10 years, although individual variability ranges from less than 1 year to long-term nonprogression. Many variables have been implicated in HIV's rate of progression, including CCR5-delta32 heterozygosity, mental health, [ 78]  concomitant drug or alcohol abuse, superinfection with another HIV strain, nutrition, and age. There is less evidence that treatment of HIV-2 infection slows progression, and certain antiretroviral medications (specifically the non-nucleoside–analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors) are not effective against HIV-2. The HIV-1 viral-load assays are much less reliable at quantifying HIV-2, if they work at all. HIV-2 viral load assays have been developed, but none has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration except as blood donor–screening tools. Once infection has progressed to AIDS, the survival period is usually less than 2 years in untreated patients. Persons in whom the infection does not progress long-term may not develop AIDS for 15 years or longer, although many still exhibit laboratory evidence of CD4 T-cell decline or dysfunction. [ 79,  80,  81,  82]  The appropriate use of combination antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections dramatically improves survival and greatly decreases the risk of secondary opportunistic infections. [ 83,  84,  85]  The risk of AIDS-associated lymphoma is not altered by antiviral therapy and, as such, has grown in prevalence among overall AIDS-defining conditions. Sackoff et al found that between 1999 and 2004, the HIV-related mortality rate in New York City decreased each year by approximately 50 deaths per 10,000 people with AIDS. The rate of non–HIV-related deaths also showed a decline, more modest but consistent, with about 7.5 fewer deaths per 10,000 people with AIDS per year. [ 84]  Importantly, many researchers have consistently shown that the primary risk factor for infection affects mortality. For example, the mortality rate among intravenous drug users tends to be higher, whether related to HIV disease or non-HIV disease. Overall, with the increasing use of antiretroviral therapy and the introduction of better antiviral regimens, survival with HIV infection has increased over time, although it is not yet equivalent to that in uninfected individuals. (See the image below.) Changes in survival of people infected with HIV. As therapies have become more aggressive, they... Changes in survival of people infected with HIV. As therapies have become more aggressive, they have been more effective, although survival with HIV infection is not yet equivalent to that in uninfected people. Modified from an original published by Lohse et al (2007), \"Survival of persons with and without HIV infection in Denmark, 1995-2005.\"  In addition to the concern for new opportunistic infections, pre-existing infections can reactivate and cause significant disease in people with AIDS. The most important example on a global scale is that of tuberculosis, as reactivated tuberculosis can cause symptomatic disease with lower levels of reactivation. Other important pathogens include cytomegalovirus, (which causes retinitis, pneumonitis, and colitis) and  Pneumocystis jiroveci  (formerly known as  Pneumocystis carinii ; the causative organism in  Pneumocystis  pneumonia). In immunocompetent hosts, these organisms are generally nonpathogenic, and asymptomatic infection is common (and in the case of cytomegalovirus infection, life-long). Antiviral medications are associated with adverse effects and thus contribute to patient morbidity and mortality rates, especially because of the growing population of long-term survivors who are receiving combination antiviral therapy. In particular, protease inhibitors may cause lipid-profile abnormalities. In a study of 6,036 HIV-infected patients who had achieved suppression of HIV with antiretroviral therapy, researchers found that the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remained high (171 per 100,000 person-years [PY]), far exceeding the rate of approximately 10 to 20 per 100,000 person-years reported in HIV-uninfected populations. The high incidence of NHL was observed even in patients with nadir CD4 cell count > 200 cells/μl (140 per 100,000 PY). After adjustment for older age, white race, male sex, HCV coinfection, and time-varying CD4 cell count, the risk of NHL risk was higher when HIV viremia was above the limit of detection (50 copies/mL) in a dose-dependent manner. [ 86,  87]  Patient Education Patients with HIV infection should be counseled about the risks of infecting their sexual partners with HIV. Safer sex practices and treatment of concurrent sexually transmitted diseases, both in the patient and in sexual partners, considerably reduces the risk of transmission. Patients with HIV infection should be encouraged to inform their sexual partners of their status; failure to do so has resulted in successful prosecutions in several countries. Sexual contacts should be tested. Some HIV-infected people actively seek out other persons with HIV infection for sex under the assumption that they are not putting themselves or anyone else at an increased risk. However, it is clear that co-infections with multiple HIV strains (whether the same or different clades) can and do occur, and that such events may result in a rapid deterioration of a previously stable infection. A growing number of new infections are drug resistant upon first presentation, suggesting that these infections were transmitted from individuals receiving therapy. Higher viral loads in the source partner are associated with higher transmission rates; thus, because barrier contraception is imperfect (although by far the best method to prevent sexual transmission), good control of viral load is important. Intravenous drug users should be counseled on the risks of sharing intravenous drug paraphernalia. For patient education information, see the  Immune System Center  and  Sexually Transmitted Diseases Center , as well as  HIV/AIDS  and  Rapid Oral HIV Test . Clinical Presentation History The history should be carefully taken to elicit possible exposures to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Risk factors include the following: Unprotected sexual intercourse, especially receptive anal intercourse (8-fold higher risk of transmission) A large number of sexual partners Prior or current sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections increase the HIV transmission risk 3-fold, syphilis raises the transmission risk 7-fold, and herpes genitalis raises the transmission risk up to 25-fold during an outbreak Sharing of intravenous drug paraphernalia Receipt of blood products (before 1985 in the United States) Mucosal contact with infected blood or needle-stick injuries Maternal HIV infection (for newborns, infants, and children): Steps taken to reduce the risk of transmission at birth include cesarean delivery and prenatal antiretroviral therapy in the mother and antiretroviral therapy in the newborn immediately after birth. The patient may present with signs and symptoms of any of the stages of HIV infection. Acute seroconversion manifests as a flulike illness, consisting of fever, malaise, and a generalized rash. The asymptomatic phase is generally benign. Generalized lymphadenopathy is common and may be a presenting symptom. AIDS manifests as recurrent, severe, and occasionally life-threatening infections and/or opportunistic malignancies. The signs and symptoms are those of the presenting illness, meaning that HIV infection should be suspected as an underlying illness when unusual infections present in apparently healthy individuals. HIV infection itself does cause some sequelae, including AIDS-associated dementia/encephalopathy and HIV wasting syndrome (chronic diarrhea and weight loss with no identifiable cause). Physical Examination No physical findings are specific to HIV infection. The physical findings are those of the presenting infection or illness. Generalized lymphadenopathy is common. Weight loss may be apparent. Evidence for risk factors or minor concurrent opportunistic infections (eg, herpetic lesions on the groin, widespread oral candidiasis) may be clues to HIV infection. Workup Approach Considerations Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is paramount, since infected individuals may remain asymptomatic for years while the infection progresses. Serologic tests are the most important studies in the evaluation for HIV infection. Secondary testing that may be performed to assist with diagnosis or staging includes the following: Viral culture Lymph node biopsy Proviral DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Genotyping of viral DNA/RNA In June 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new recommendations for HIV testing in laboratories that are aimed at reducing the time needed to diagnose HIV infection by as much as 3-4 weeks over previous testing approaches. The new testing algorithm is performed as follows [ 88,  89]  : Diagnosis starts with a fourth-generation test that detects HIV in the blood earlier than antibody tests can; it identifies the viral protein HIV-1 p24 antigen, which appears in the blood before antibodies do If this test is positive, an immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies should be performed; results from such assays can be obtained faster than they can from the Western blot test In patients with positive results on the initial antigen test but with negative or indeterminate results on the antibody differentiation assay, HIV-1 nucleic acid testing should be performed to determine whether infection is present In August 2013, the FDA approved the Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo test (Orgenics, Ltd), the first rapid HIV test for the simultaneous detection of HIV-1 p24 antigen as well as antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in human serum, plasma, and venous or fingerstick whole blood specimens. Detection of HIV-1 antigen permits earlier detection of HIV-1 infection than is possible by testing for HIV-1 antibodies alone. [ 6,  7]  This rapid test can be used in outreach settings to identify HIV-infected individuals who might not be able to be tested in traditional health care settings. The test does not distinguish between antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2, and is not intended to be used for screening of blood donors. [ 6,  7]  Staging of HIV disease is based partially on clinical presentation, but other laboratory tests can help in deciding whether to initiate or modify treatment. Baseline laboratory studies for other infections (eg, tuberculosis) are important in the initial workup of a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection. In addition, baseline levels of factors that may be affected by antiretroviral therapy (eg, lipids) should be measured. Screening for HIV Infection The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians screen for HIV in all adolescents and adults at increased risk for HIV infection, and all pregnant women. [ 1]  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all females aged 13-64 years be tested for HIV at least once during their lifetime. [ 90,  91]  Retesting annually or more often is recommended for those at high risk because of injection drug use, sex with an injection drug user, sex for money or drugs, sex since their most recent HIV test with men who have sex with men, or sex since their most recent HIV test with more than 1 person. Guidelines issued in 2015 on HIV testing during pregnancy by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are as follows: [ 92,  93]  Women should be tested for HIV during routine prenatal testing, on an opt-out basis when possible. Women at high risk for HIV infection, including injection drug users and women with multiple sex partners during their pregnancy, should be retested in their third trimester. Women who have not been tested should be offered rapid screening when in labor; if the rapid test result is positive, antiretroviral therapy should be initiated while awaiting results of a confirmatory test. All pregnant women should be screened for HIV infection as early as possible during each pregnancy using the opt-out approach when allowed. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended among women in areas with high HIV incidence or prevalence and among women known to be at risk for acquiring HIV infection. Women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise undocumented should be offered rapid screening upon labor and delivery using the opt-out approach when allowed. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while awaiting supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HIV screening for patients in all health-care settings, after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening); the CDC recommends that persons at high risk for HIV infection be screened for HIV at least annually. [ 2]  Citing the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment and the failure of risk-based screening to identify a substantial proportion of HIV-infected patients early in the disease, the American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians adopt routine screening for HIV and encourage all patients to be tested. [ 3]  Screening assays A high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) should be used for screening. Most ELISAs can be used to detect HIV-1 types M, N, and O and HIV-2. A positive ELISA result should be followed with confirmatory testing in the form of one or more Western blot assays or similar specific assay. Specific diagnostic criteria vary by test. Results are typically reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate. Testing for HIV-2 should be ensured for patients from an HIV-2 endemic area or those who have indeterminate results on HIV-1 Western blot testing. Not all HIV tests include detection of HIV-2 or Group O. In New York City, 62 cases of HIV-2 were detected over an 8-year period, of which 40 were initially misdiagnosed as HIV-1. [ 94]  Early detection using combination screens may be more effective than simply using serology. The additional detection of p24 antigen or viral RNA may detect a greater number of very recent infections before seroconversion occurs. This would likely result in significant reductions in transmission as well as overall health costs and healthcare burden. [ 95]  To address the problem of confirmatory supplemental tests giving false-negative results early in the course of HIV infection, the CDC conducted two prospective evaluations of a new HIV diagnostic algorithm. The new diagnostic algorithm replaces the Western blot (WB) with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay as the supplemental test and includes an RNA test to resolve reactive immunoassay (IA) with negative supplemental test results. [ 96]  CD4+ T-cell Count The CD4 T-cell count is a reliable indicator of the current risk of acquiring opportunistic infections. CD4 counts vary, and serial counts are generally a better measure of any significant changes. The reference range for CD4 counts is 500-2000 cells/μL. After seroconversion, CD4 counts tend to decrease (around 700/μL on average) and continue to decline over time. For surveillance purposes, a CD4 count under 200/μL is considered AIDS-defining in the United States owing to the increased risk of opportunistic infections at this level. The magnitude of discordance between absolute CD4 T-cell numbers and CD4 T-cell percentages is greatest in those with active hepatitis C virus and more advanced liver disease. [ 97]  In children under five years of age, the CD4 T-cell percentage is considered more important than the absolute count. (Less than 25% is considered worthy of starting therapy, regardless of the total CD4 count). In adults with chronic hepatitis C and low absolute CD4 T-cells, the CD4 percentage may also be more useful, due to probable T-cell sequestration in the liver. [ 4]  Viral Load Viral load in peripheral blood is used as a surrogate marker of viral replication rate. This is a surrogate because most of the viral replication occurs in the lymph nodes rather than in the peripheral blood. The test is a quantitative amplification of the viral RNA using nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or similar technologies. Quantitative viral-load assays should not be used as a diagnostic tool because several false-positive misdiagnoses have been reported in the literature. The rate of progression to AIDS and death is related to the viral load, although, on an individual level, it is poorly predictive of the absolute rate of CD4 T-cell loss. Patients with viral loads greater than 30,000/μL are 18.5 times more likely to die of AIDS than those with undetectable viral loads. With therapy, viral loads can often be suppressed to an undetectable level (ie, < 20-75 copies/mL, depending on the assay used); this is considered optimal viral suppression. At the same time, the CD4 count rises and the risk of opportunistic infections and death is reduced. Complete inhibition of viral replication appears impossible and may be unnecessary. Not uncommonly, successfully treated patients will demonstrate intermittent viremia, with viral loads transiently detectable at low levels (typically, < 400 copies/mL); this appears to occur more commonly with some viral load assays than others. Such “blips” are not thought to represent viral replication or to predict virologic failure. [ 5]  Virologic failure is defined as a confirmed viral load of more than 200 copies/mL; although this is a research definition, it may be useful in clinical practice. [ 5]  Secondary HIV Testing Viral culture is expensive and time-consuming and is less sensitive in patients with low viral loads. Viral culture may be performed as part of phenotypic drug-resistance testing. Lymph node architecture is disrupted during HIV infection. HIV DNA, RNA, and proteins may be detected with molecular techniques, and electron microscopy may reveal virions. Proviral DNA PCR is usually performed only in newborns because conventional serologic testing is useless in these patients (maternal antibodies may persist for 9 months or longer). Two or more negative results separated by at least one month is considered a negative result. Genotyping of viral DNA/RNA can guide therapy. Because patterns of mutations that lead to resistance to specific drugs or drug classes are now well-recognized, sequencing of the viral genome allows for the selection of specific antivirals that are more likely to elicit a response. Baseline Studies Baseline studies for other infections that are important in the initial workup of a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection include the following: Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin testing for tuberculosis Cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing Syphilis testing Rapid amplification testing for gonococcal and chlamydial infection Hepatitis A, B, and C serology Anti- Toxoplasma  antibody Ophthalmologic examination A purified protein derivative skin test is placed to evaluate for tuberculosis infection. Chest radiography should be performed in patients with a positive PPD test result. Serology should be performed to test for CMV infection. The presence of anti-CMV IgG indicates previous exposure to CMV. Ophthalmologic examination is used to evaluate for CMV retinitis in people with very low CD4 T-cell counts. For syphilis screening, rapid plasma reagent (RPR) testing can be used initially, but more specific testing should be used for follow-up, as RPR can yield false-positive results. Lumbar puncture is used to evaluate neurologic symptoms. Rapid amplification testing is used to evaluate for gonococcal infection and chlamydia in cases of sexual HIV transmission. Pelvic examination is performed in females (with wet mount for trichomoniasis). Hepatitis A, B, and C serology is performed to determine the need for vaccination or treatment and to evaluate for chronic infection. Patients infected with hepatitis C may be candidates for treatment. Genotyping and baseline liver function tests are crucial. Anti- Toxoplasma  antibody is measured to determine whether patients have had toxoplasmosis, and thus are at risk for reactivation of infection in the event of immunocompromise. Patients with prior  Toxoplasma  infection require prophylaxis if their CD4 +  T-cell counts drop below 100/µL. Tests to establish baseline values of factors that may be affected by antiretroviral therapy include the following: Liver function tests Serum chemistries Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/serum creatinine Fasting lipid panel Vitamin B12 and folate levels Thyroid function studies [ 98]  Other tests include urinalysis to evaluate for  HIV-associated nephropathy  and a drug screen to effectively exclude other metabolic and infectious etiologies. [ 99]  Histologic Findings Certain histologic findings are characteristic of various features of HIV infection and AIDS. The lymph node architecture is progressively disrupted; this can be reversed with effective antiviral therapy. Findings include hyperplasia, multinucleated syncytia of T cells, and loss of the normal follicular dendritic network. Nucleic acid or immunohistochemical stains for viral antigens shows virus localizing to macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells. Electron microscopy may reveal virions or intracellular virus within phagosomes in macrophages. Multinucleated giant cells are a characteristic finding in patients with HIV encephalopathy. Myelin pallor and microgliosis may also be observed. Staging The CDC classifies HIV infection into 3 categories, according to the presence of certain infections or diseases. [ 8]  These conditions may be exacerbated by the HIV infection or represent true opportunistic infections. Category A is asymptomatic HIV infection without a history of symptoms or AIDS-defining conditions. Category B is HIV infection with symptoms that are directly attributable to HIV infection (or a defect in T-cell–mediated immunity) or that are complicated by HIV infection. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Bacillary angiomatosis Oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush) Vulvovaginal candidiasis, persistent or resistant Pelvic inflammatory disease  (PID) Cervical dysplasia (moderate or severe)/ cervical carcinoma in situ Oral hairy leukoplakia Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Constitutional symptoms, such as fever (>38.5°C) or diarrhea lasting more than 1 month Peripheral neuropathy Herpes zoster  (shingles), involving 2 or more episodes or 1 or more dermatomes Category C is HIV infection with AIDS-defining opportunistic infections, as outlined in Pathophysiology. These 3 categories are further subdivided based on the CD4 +  T-cell count. Categories A1, B1, and C1 are characterized by CD4 +  T-cell counts greater than 500/µL. Categories A2, B2, and C2 are characterized by CD4 +  T-cell counts between 200/µL and 400/µL. HIV infections in patient with CD4 +  T-cell counts under 200/µL are designated as A3, B3, or C3. Importantly, once an HIV infection has been staged into a higher clinical category, it remains in that category permanently. In addition, the infection is classified based on the lowest CD4 +  T-cell count in that patient. For example, if a given HIV-positive patient recovers from a bout of  Pneumocystis  pneumonia (PCP) and the CD4 +  T-cell count improves from 50/µL to 250/µL, that patient’s HIV infection remains classified as C3. Persons with A3, B3, and C1-3 HIV infection are considered to have AIDS. This is important to recognize, as this designation is not based solely on the previous occurrence of opportunistic infections but rather on the current risk of infection based on a reduced CD4 +  T-cell count. Treatment & Management Approach Considerations The treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease depends on the stage of the disease and any concomitant opportunistic infections. [ 5]  In general, the goal of treatment is to prevent the immune system from deteriorating to the point that opportunistic infections become more likely. Immune reconstitution syndrome is also less likely in patients whose immune systems are weakened to this point. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the principal method for preventing immune deterioration. In addition, prophylaxis for specific opportunistic infections is indicated in particular cases. Successful long-term HAART results in a gradual recovery of CD4 T-cell numbers and an improvement of immune responses and T-cell repertoire (previously lost antigen responses may be restored). The peripheral T-cell counts initially surge after therapy is initiated, but this represents redistribution of activated T cells from the viral replication centers in the lymph nodes rather than a true increase in total-body CD4 T-cell counts. [ 100,  101]  In addition to virologic response and reduced risk of opportunistic infection, there is evidence to suggest that non-AIDS-defining illnesses, in particular psychiatric and renal disease, may also be reduced when on HAART. Although multifactorial in nature (transmission mode and patient educational level are independent risk factors for these events) there may also be a direct role of HIV in these events, or an indirect role mediated through the subsequent immune dysfunction. Some non-AIDS-defining illnesses, such as liver and cardiovascular disease, are not improved by HAART. [ 102]  Treatment guidelines for HIV infection are age-specific. Guidelines for pediatric populations are compiled by the Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children; guidelines for adults and adolescents are compiled by the Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV Infection. Complete treatment guidelines may be viewed at the  National Institutes of Health  Web site. For discussion of antiretroviral drugs and regimens, see  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . Primary care interventions The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued updated guidelines in November 2013 for the management of HIV infection. [ 103,  104]  Because of advances in management, HIV-infected patients are now having fewer complications and surviving longer; as a result, they are increasingly experiencing common health problems seen in the general population, and these problems must be addressed. Accordingly, the updated IDSA guidelines emphasize the role of primary care interventions, as follows: HIV-infected individuals should undergo screening for diabetes, osteoporosis, and colon cancer as appropriate and should be vaccinated against pneumococcal infection, influenza, varicella, and hepatitis A and B Lipid monitoring and management of lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors should be performed Patients with well-controlled infection should undergo blood monitoring for viral levels every 6-12 months Women with HIV should undergo annual trichomoniasis screening, and all infected patients who may be at risk should undergo annual screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia HAART Studies and DHHS Guidelines The introduction of HAART has significantly improved mortality rates. One study of nearly 7000 men with HIV infection found that annual mortality rates decreased from 7% in 1996 to 1.3% in 2004, although the findings highlighted the fact that non–AIDS-related illnesses were accounting for a greater proportion of deaths. [ 85]  These findings were repeated in another, more recent study of over 83,000 people with AIDS in the United States from 1990-2006, [ 105]  which showed that cancers as a cause of mortality decreased overall but increased as a percentage of deaths, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma being the most common AIDS-related cancer and lung cancer being the most common non–AIDS-related cancer. A National Cancer Institute study attributed increased non-AIDS-defining cancer mortality to the 4-fold expansion in the HIV-infected population in the United States, which was largely driven by greater numbers of people aged 40 years and older. [ 106]  Treatment failures are most closely related to the timing of therapy initiation (and, therefore, of timeliness of diagnosis). CD4 counts under 200/μL and evidence for AIDS (in the form of cytomegalovirus retinitis) are strong predictors of mortality (risk ratios of 2.7 and 1.6, respectively). [ 107]  Research data led to US guidelines recommending that antiretroviral therapy be initiated at a CD4 count threshold of 350/μL, although 2013 guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) now recommend a threshold of 500/μL. [ 108,  109]  They also state that in some cases, antiretroviral treatment should begin immediately, regardless of the CD4 count, including in HIV-positive serodiscordant couples, patients with hepatitis-B coinfection, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children under age 5 years. [ 108,  109]  Updated 2013 guidelines from the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) advise that antiretroviral drugs be considered and actively discussed even with asymptomatic patients with HIV whose CD4 count is still higher than 500/μL. [ 110,  111]  In addition, they address diagnosis and management of comorbid conditions, including the following: Hypertension Type 2 diabetes Bone disease - Osteopenia, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and osteonecrosis (fracture reduction is a newly addressed topic in the guidelines) Dyslipidemia Vitamin D deficiency Kidney disease - Antiretroviral drug–associated nephrotoxicity, proximal renal tubulopathy Liver disease - Increased liver enzymes, cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome Lipodystrophy Hyperlactemia and lactic acidosis Sexual dysfunction (a new topic in the guidelines) Depression Studies on the initiation of antiretroviral therapy An analysis of a series of 18 prospective cohort studies in the United Kingdom found that deferring combination antiretroviral therapy until patients reached a CD4 cell count of 251-350 cells/μL was associated with higher rates of AIDS and death than starting therapy at 351-450 cells/μL. The adverse effect of deferring treatment increased with decreasing CD4 cell count threshold. The researchers suggested than the minimum threshold for initiating treatment should be 350 CD4 +  T cells/μL rather than 200/μL. [ 112]  This finding was echoed in a Haitian study (a resource-limited setting), where early initiation of antiretroviral therapy significantly decreased the rates of death and incident tuberculosis. Initiating antiretroviral therapy treatment during early phases of disease (CD4 +  T-cell count between 200/μL and 350/μL) was found to increase survival in Haitians compared with waiting until CD4 +  T cells fell below 200/μL. [ 113]  The HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration analyzed data from the United States Veterans Health Administration and HIV clinics in Europe to compare the results of therapy initiation at CD4 cell counts from 0.200-0.500 × 10 9  cells/L. The study concluded that initiating HAART therapy at the 0.350 × 10 9  cells/L threshold decreased AIDS-free survival compared with initiation at 0.500 × 10 9  cells/L, but did not substantially increase mortality. A significant rise in mortality was seen at initiation thresholds below 0.300 × 10 9  cells/L. This result differs from other studies. Because CD4 cell count at initiation is not randomized in such observational cohort studies, confounding factors may exist. [ 114]  The first randomized controlled trial to investigate the question of when to initiate therapy was the NIH Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA) HT 001 clinical study. This work showed that starting antiretroviral therapy at CD4 +  T-cell counts between 200 and 350 cells/µL improves survival compared with deferring treatment until the CD4 +  T-cell count drops to less than 200 cells/µL (the standard of care at the time). Interim analysis of CIPRA HT 001 showed that of 816 HIV-infected adults with early HIV disease, 6 of those who began antiretroviral therapy within 2 weeks of enrollment (early treatment) died, while 23 participants in the standard-of-care group died. [ 115]  Among participants who began the study without tuberculosis infection, 18 individuals in the early treatment group developed tuberculosis, while 36 people in the standard-of-care group developed tuberculosis. These interim results were statistically significant and led to ending the trial early to offer antiretroviral therapy to all participants in the standard-of-care group with a CD4 +  T-cell count of less than 350 cells/µL. One study has suggested that extremely early initiation of antiretroviral therapy during this acute seroconversion period (within 2 weeks of converting) may result in better long-term CD4 counts and steady-state viral load. Although the numbers were small, acutely-treated individuals had a mean of 0.48 Log10 copies/ml lower viral load, and higher CD4 counts (average 112 cells/µL) than an untreated cohort. The effects were less pronounced and lasted for a shorter time for patients with an “early” initiation of therapy (within 2 weeks to 6 months of seroconversion). [ 116]  There have been attempts made to characterize the timeframe of seroconversion, especially in patients without a clear source of exposure which can be dated accurately. Although imperfect, algorithms based on the number of Western Blot bands and the actual ELISA signal compared to the positive cutoff may have some utility here. [ 117]  Therapy initiation recommendations in the United States In July 2014, the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) released antiretroviral treatment recommendations for adults, including the following: [ 118,  119]  Initiate ART in all HIV-infected adults who are willing/ready to start therapy. CD4 count is no longer considered a criterion of when to start therapy. Consider NRTI-sparing approaches rather than boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy. For refractory cases, during the failing treatment regimen and before switching therapy, use rapid confirmation, perform resistance testing, and reevaluate. Antiretroviral agents Classes of antiretroviral agents include the following: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Fusion inhibitors CCR5 co-receptor antagonists (entry inhibitors) HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors Current drug regimen recommendations The April 2015 DHHS guideline lists the following regimens as preferred in treatment-naive patients: INSTI-based regimens are as follows: \t\t Dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) - only for patients who are HLA-B*5701–negative DTG plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) Elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) - only for patients with pre-ART CrCl of >70 mL/min Raltegravir (RAL) plus TDF/FTC The PI/r-based regimen is darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) plus TDF/FTC HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to NNRTIs and enfuvirtide. Women who become pregnant while taking antiretroviral agents should contact their physician and register with the  Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry Regimen selection Antiretrovirals should be prescribed by an infectious disease specialist. Antiretroviral regimen selection is individualized, on the basis of the following [ 5]  : Virologic efficacy Toxicity Pill burden Dosing frequency Drug-drug interaction potential Drug resistance testing results Comorbid conditions Drug resistance testing typically involves genotyping or phenotyping of resistance in the patient's viral strains. The January 2011 DHHS guidelines recommend genotypic testing to guide the choice of initial therapy in antiretroviral-naïve patients, as well as in patients in whom first or second regimens produce a suboptimal virologic response or virologic failure. Phenotypic testing is generally added to genotypic testing when complex drug resistance mutation patterns, especially to protease inhibitors, are confirmed or suspected. [ 5]  Recent research on antiretroviral agents A review of 2725 HIV isolates for protease inhibitor susceptibility helped delineate the specific contributions of various resistance mutations to each currently available protease inhibitor. The study revealed that certain mutations could result in increased susceptibility to a particular drug, and that some effects on resistance had been underestimated. The study concluded that cross-resistance between the various protease inhibitors now and in the future may be missed without systematic analysis of the effects of specific mutations. [ 120]  A study by Lennox et al in treatment-naive patients from 67 centers on 5 continents demonstrated benefits of raltegravir (another INSTI) over efavirenz (an NNRTI) as part of combination antiretroviral therapy. [ 121]  Participants had viral RNA (vRNA) concentrations greater than 5000 copies/mL and demonstrated no baseline drug resistance to efavirenz, tenofovir, or emtricitabine. They were randomly assigned to receive raltegravir 400 mg bid (n=281) or efavirenz 600 mg daily (n=282). The primary endpoint was a vRNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at week 48. In the raltegravir group, 86.1% achieved the primary endpoint, compared with 81.9% in the efavirenz group (difference 4.2%, 95% CI, -1.9 to 10.3). The time to viral suppression was shorter in the raltegravir group than in the efavirenz group. Significantly fewer adverse drug reactions were reported in the raltegravir group (44.1%) than in the efavirenz group (77%). [ 121]  Similarly, in a randomized, phase III, noninferiority trial of raltegravir-based treatment versus efavirenz-based therapy, in 563 treatment-naïve HIV-1–infected patients, the addition of raltegravir to tenofovir/emtricitabine, compared with the addition of efavirenz to tenofovir/emtricitabine, resulted in significantly greater vRNA suppression rates and increases in baseline CD4 counts at week 240. In addition, significantly fewer patients in the raltegravir group experienced neuropsychiatric and drug-related adverse events. [ 122]  A new INSTI, dolutegravir (Tivicay), was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents in adults and children aged 12 years or older who weigh at least 40 kg. Approval was based on several studies showing evidence of virologic suppression in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients on a daily regimen of the drug. [ 123,  124,  125,  126]  Approval of dolutegravir for the indication in children aged 12 years or older was based on data in integrase-naïve patients. Knowledge of resistance patterns in resource-limited areas is vital in the selection of first-line antiretroviral treatment. In a subset of the Development of Antiretroviral Treatment in Africa (DART) trial, the virological response to zidovudine-lamivudine plus abacavir (an NRTI) at 32 weeks was inferior to the response to zidovudine-lamivudine plus nevirapine (an NNRTI). HIV RNA levels were lower in the nevirapine group than in the abacavir group. The authors concluded that first-line zidovudine-lamivudine plus abacavir therapy will eventually lead to extensive nucleoside analogue resistance and that continued research is needed to optimize first- and second-line therapies in resource-limited settings. [ 127]  Approval of the ART combination product elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Stribild) was based on analyses of 48-week data from 2 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected individuals (n=1408). Results showed a single tablet regimen of Stribild met its primary objective of noninferiority compared to Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir 300 mg) and to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir). [ 128,  129]  In a study of 484 HIV-infected pregnant women, 3 short-term antiretroviral strategies, initiated simultaneously with the administration of single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP), resulted in a low rate (1.2%) of new NVP-resistance mutations. In the study, HIV-infected pregnant women were randomized to receive sdNVP and either zidovudine/lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir/emtricitabine (FTC), or lopinavir/ritonavir for either 7 or 21 days. According to theresults, 21-day antiretroviral regimens are better at preventing the emergence of minor NVP resistance variants compared to 7-day regimens. Of the 412 women who had primary endpoint results available, 4 of 215 in the 7-day arms had new NVP resistance (1.9%), whereas only 1 of 197 (0.5%) in the 21-day arms exhibited the same resistance. [ 130]  Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections Prophylaxis for  Pneumocystis jiroveci  (a normally harmless commensal organism) is most important, as this causes a common, preventable, serious infection. In patients with CD4 counts of less than 200/μL, prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; Bactrim) has been shown to prevent  Pneumocystis  pneumonia (PCP). In patients whose CD4 +  T-cell counts rise above 200/μL with effective therapy, PCP prophylaxis may be discontinued. When TMP-SMX cannot be used, alternatives include dapsone (after screening for  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency ) and atovaquone or monthly nebulized pentamidine treatments. TMP-SMX also prevents  toxoplasmosis  and should be administered when the CD4 +  T-cell count drops to below 100/µL if the patient is not already receiving it to prevent PCP. CD4 +  counts below 50/µL place the patient at risk for  Mycobacterium avium  complex infection , and weekly azithromycin or clarithromycin is recommended as prophylaxis. Prophylaxis for fungal or viral infections is not routinely necessary, but some have recommended fluconazole in patients with CD4 +  T-cell counts under 50/µL to prevent candidal or cryptococcal infections and to protect against endemic fungal infections in geographic locales of hyperendemicity for  histoplasmosis  or  coccidioidomycosis . However, the emergence of resistant  Candida  strains is a realistic concern. Oral ganciclovir is indicated for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infection in patients with advanced AIDS and is about 50% effective in reducing invasive disease. [ 131]  As with fluconazole, there are concerns about resistance, and prophylaxis should be reserved for those with CD4 +  T-cell counts under 50/µL and evidence of previous cytomegalovirus infection. Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Treatment of opportunistic infections is paramount and should be directed at the specific pathogen. Although effective antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of acquiring an opportunistic infection and reverses the effects of many opportunistic infections (eg, Kaposi sarcoma, cytomegalovirus retinitis), aggressive treatment of life-threatening or otherwise serious infections may necessitate a temporary stay of antiretroviral therapy to avoid drug interactions or cumulative toxicity. With specific regard to TB, the relationship with antiretroviral therapy is complex. A large multi-national study found that the relative risk of acquiring TB after starting HAART was approximately half that of those in whom HAART was not started. However, there was evidence for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in some patients co-infected with HIV and TB in the first few months of therapy. In addition, those older than 50, or with pretreatment CD4 T-cell counts less than 50/µL, were less likely to see the same reduction in TB incidence. [ 132]  Treatment of HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy HIV lipodystrophy  is a syndrome of abnormal central fat accumulation and/or localized loss of fat tissue that occurs in patients taking antiretroviral drugs. Tesamorelin (Egrifta), a growth hormone–releasing factor, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010 to reduce excess visceral abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. FDA approval of tesamorelin was based on 2 studies in which visceral adipose tissue was significantly decreased from baseline at 26 weeks and sustained at 52 weeks. [ 133,  134,  135]  These multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies consisting of a 26-week main phase and a 26-week extension phase in 816 HIV-infected patients with excess abdominal fat associated with lipodystrophy. In phase III, randomized, double-blind studies that assessed the effect of tesamorelin on HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation, a reduction in adiposity correlated with overall improved metabolic profiles of lipids and glucose. [ 136]  Suppressive Therapy for Herpes Simplex Virus 2 Infection Most individuals infected with HIV-1 are also infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Suppressive therapy of HSV-2 with acyclovir reduces plasma HIV-1 concentrations. Lingappa et al found that acyclovir reduced risk for HIV-1 disease progression by 16% compared with placebo. [ 137]  Disease progression was defined as first occurrence of CD4 +  T-cell counts dropping below 200/μL. In this study, patients (n=3381) who were dually infected with HSV-2 and HIV-1, had CD4 +  cell counts of at least 250/μL, and were not taking antiretroviral therapy were randomized to receive either acyclovir 400 mg PO orally twice daily or placebo. In patients with CD4 +  counts of 350/μL or more, acyclovir delayed risk of CD4 +  counts falling below 350/μL by 19%. The use of acyclovir to suppress HSV-2 before initiating antiretroviral therapy merits further study to determine its effects on HIV-1 disease progression. A second study of 440 people in Uganda showed that, in those with HIV and HSV-2 as well as HIV viral loads above 50,000, there was a significant delay in the progression to AIDS-defining illnesses or CD4 T-cell decline in the acyclovir group compared to placebo. Interestingly, no significant benefit was found for those with viral loads below 50,000. [ 138]  Treatment of HIV-Associated Diarrhea In December 2012, the FDA approved crofelemer for the relief of diarrhea in patients with HIV/AIDS who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy. [ 9]  However, before patients are treated with this drug, they should be properly tested to confirm that the diarrhea is not caused by an infection or a gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Deterrence and Prevention of HIV Infection On an individual level, the most effective methods for prevention of HIV infection include (1) avoidance of sexual contact outside a monogamous relationship, (2) the use of safer sex practices for all other sexual encounters, and (3) abstinence from nonmedical parenteral drug use. In addition, measures can also be taken to prevent or deter HIV transmission risk from infected persons to noninfected individuals through behavioral, biomedical, and structural interventions aimed at reducing their infectiousness and their risk of exposing others to HIV. Such measures are detailed in the CDC's Recommendations for  HIV Prevention With Adults and Adolescents With HIV in the United States, 2014 . [ 139]  Sexual transmission Prevention measures include the following: Abstinence when possible Reduction in number of sexual partners Using barrier contraception Treatment of concurrent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Testing of self and partner for HIV infection and other STDs Concomitant infection with other STDs (eg, gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis) is the most well-known risk factor that predisposes to transmission of HIV. These STDs may cause mucosal ulcerations or tears or a higher concentration of inflammatory cells in the mucosa, which are targets for HIV infection. Comprehensive testing for these should be obtained when a sexual transmission is suspected or the source of infection is unknown, both in the patient and in sexual partners. Certain sexual acts are more likely to lead to HIV infection than others. For example, fellatio carries the lowest risk of transmission (with very few case reports in the literature), while receptive anal intercourse carries the highest risk (a likelihood of approximately 1.5% per act with an infected individual). An apparent effect of hormonal contraception on HIV transmission to and from women has been reported, with a slight but statistically significant increase in transmission involving women on hormonal contraception. In a study of 3790 serodiscordant couples from Africa, the hazard ratios for transmission were 1.98 to, and 1.97 from women on hormonal contraception. Although barrier contraception should be employed in instances of serodiscordance anyway, this finding further strengthens that recommendation in those couples where the female partner is using hormonal contraception. [ 140]  Vertical transmission Prevention measures include the following: Maternal testing Effective control of maternal infection Prenatal antiviral therapy and treatment of mother and infant during labor, delivery, and the neonatal period Cesarean delivery Avoidance of breastfeeding (unless local conditions make this unsafe or unfeasible) A retrospective cohort study reviewed the records of 3,273 HIV-positive women receiving prenatal care in Malawi and Mozambique from July 2005 to December 2009. Patients were treated with triple antiviral therapy during pregnancy until 6 months postpartum for prevention of vertical transmission. Regardless of CD4 count, ART provided a protective effect against mortality, fetal demise, and premature birth. [ 141]  The prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-2 is less certain than for HIV-1, from which most of the recommendations have been derived. Transmission of HIV-2 is less frequent (perhaps 10-fold less efficient), but HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to the non-nucleoside RTI nevirapine, removing one option for pharmacologic prophylaxis at the time of delivery. In a large French cohort study, the mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV-2 infection was 0.6%. [ 142]  Transmission was related to poor control of HIV-2 infection in the mother or due to breastfeeding. In the absence of definitive clinical trial data, the only definite conclusion is that effective control of maternal infection is paramount, and other nonspecific measures (identification of infected mothers, caesarean section, avoidance of breastfeeding) are probably effective at preventing transmission. Empiric prophylaxis with zidovudine, as in HIV-1 infection, is probably warranted and effective but does not appear to be evidence-based. Blood-borne transmission Prevention measures include the following: Blood-product and donor screening Avoidance of reusing needles for intravenous drug abuse (needle-exchange programs are widespread in the developed world, but the evidence that they have had a significant effect is debatable) Postexposure prophylaxis The CDC has recommended basic and expanded HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. For details, see the  Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis . Also see the Medscape Reference articles  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection  and  Body Fluid Exposures . An overview of the CDC recommendations for PEP are as follows: Basic PEP 2-drug regimen: zidovudine plus lamivudine, zidovudine plus emtricitabine, tenofovir plus lamivudine, or tenofovir plus emtricitabine Alternative basic PEP regimen: lamivudine plus stavudine, lamivudine plus didanosine, emtricitabine plus stavudine, or emtricitabine plus didanosine Expanded PEP regimen: basic PEP regimen plus lopinavir-ritonavir An alternative expanded PEP regimen includes the basic PEP regimen plus one of the following: Atazanavir with or without ritonavir Fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir Indinavir with or without ritonavir Saquinavir with or without ritonavir Nelfinavir Efavirenz Use of nevirapine for PEP is generally not recommended because of a risk of early onset rash and severe hepatotoxicity. Vaccination efforts The initial hope of an effective vaccine against HIV has not been fulfilled. Aside from the virus being able to rapidly mutate antigenic portions of key surface proteins, HIV infection progresses despite the host’s humoral and cellular immune responses; therefore, any vaccination effect needs to surpass the normal host response to HIV. A study from Thailand suggests a possible benefit of vaccines in heterosexuals at risk for HIV-1 transmission. [ 143]  In the randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by Rerks-Ngarm et al, 16,402 healthy participants aged 18-30 years received either 4 priming injections of recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) plus 2 booster shots of recombinant glycoprotein 120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) or placebo. In the per-protocol analysis, which excluded subjects who seroconverted during the vaccination series, the vaccine efficacy was 26.2%. In the modified-intention-to-treat analysis, which excluded subjects who had baseline HIV-1 infection, the vaccine efficacy was 31.2%. However, the 95% confidence intervals in these analyses were extremely wide (-13.3 to 51.9 and 1.1 to 52.1, respectively), which precludes concluding that the vaccine had proven efficacy. [ 143]  Among study subjects who developed HIV-1 infection, viremia and CD4 +  T cell counts were unchanged by vaccination. This suggests that, if infection did occur, there was no apparent immunologic benefit from having received the vaccine. With respect to risk behavior, a post-hoc analysis of efficacy found that the combination of the HIV vaccines, ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) and AIDSVAX B/E, was more effective in those who maintained lower-risk sexual behavior compared to those that reported high or increasing-risk behavior. [ 144]  Preexposure prophylaxis An innovative and controversial strategy for preventing HIV transmission is regular use of antiretroviral medications by uninfected individuals. An updated clinical practice guideline released in May 2014 by the CDC, extends recommendations for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV in high-risk patients. [ 145,  146]  According to these guidelines, PrEP should be considered for the following non-HIV-infected individuals: Anyone who is in an ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV-infected partner A gay or bisexual man who has had sex without a condom or has been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection within the past 6 months and is not in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who recently tested HIV-negative A heterosexual man or woman who does not always use condoms when having sex with partners known to be at risk for HIV and is not in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who recently tested HIV-negative Anyone who, in the preceding 6 months, has injected illicit drugs and shared equipment or been in a treatment program for injection drug use Daily oral PrEP with the fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg (Truvada) has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing the risk of sexual HIV acquisition in adults. Daily emtricitabine/tenofovir is one prevention option that is part of the general guidelines for HIV prevention. For more information, see  Preexposure HIV Prophylaxis . PrEP treatment guidelines include the following recommendations: Acute and chronic HIV infection must be excluded by symptom history and HIV testing immediately before PrEP is prescribed; evidence level IA The only medication regimen approved by the FDA and recommended for PrEP with all the populations specified in the CDC guideline is daily TDF 300 mg coformulated with FTC 200 mg (Truvada); evidence level IA TDF alone has shown substantial efficacy and safety in trials with IDUs and heterosexually active adults and can be considered as an alternative regimen for these populations, but not for MSM, among whom its efficacy has not been studied; evidence level IC Use of other ART medications for PrEP, either in place of or in addition to TDF/FTC (or TDF) is not recommended; evidence level IIIA Oral PrEP for coitally-timed or other noncontinuous daily use is not recommended; evidence level IIIA Interim CDC guidelines were issued in 2011 based on the multinational study called the Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx) trial that found that once-daily emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF) provided an additional 44% protection against HIV infection in a study population of 2499 high-risk, HIV-negative men or transgender women who have sex with men. [ 147]  Over a median 1.2 years of follow up, 36 patients in the FTC-TDF group and 64 in the placebo group became infected with HIV. All study subjects also received comprehensive prevention services that included monthly HIV testing, condom provision, counseling, and management of other STDs. [ 147]  Additional studies have been completed or are ongoing in serodiscordant heterosexual couples and intravenous drug users. [ 148,  149]  There remain policy considerations surrounding costs, opportunity costs, and ethical issues that must be addressed before broad implementation in the United States. [ 150]  Potential drawbacks include the possibility that pre-exposure prophylaxis may encourage some recipients to practice less-safe sex; it does not address transmission of other STDs; and it could encourage the development of drug resistance. Compliance is essential. In studies, the level of protection varied widely depending on how consistently participants used pre-exposure prophylaxis. Among those whose data (based on self-reports, bottles dispensed, and pill counts) indicate use on 90% or more days, HIV risk was reduced by 73%. Among those whose adherence by the same measure was less than 90%, HIV risk was reduced by only 21%. [ 151,  152]  Topical antivirals could potentially help with preventing transmission, but studies to date have failed to produce positive results. For example, a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of a vaginal microbicide gel with in vitro activity against HIV failed to show protective effects. The study involved 9385 women from South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia who used a synthetic naphthalene sulphonate polymer. Infection rates per 100 person-years were similar between groups (4.7 for 2% gel, 4.6 for 0.5% gel, and 3.9 for placebo). IAS-USA guidelines In July 2014, the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) released new recommendations for HIV prevention in adolescents and adults in clinical care settings [ 153,  118]  in conjunction with updated recommendations on antiretroviral treatment (ART) of adult HIV infection. [ 118,  119]  The IAS-USA panel suggested that combined biomedical/behavioral approaches to HIV prevention in clinical settings have the potential to not only prevent the disease but also cause nearly all HIV-infected individuals to become noninfectious. [ 153,  118]  Among its key HIV-prevention recommendations for teens and adults are the following [ 153,  118]  : Perform HIV testing at least once for all adults and adolescents; repeat testing often for those at increased risk. Be vigilant for potential HIV infection, and promptly perform diagnostic testing in those with suspected acute HIV infection. For HIV-confirmed patients, provide multimodal interventions to include prompt initiation of ART, support for treatment adherence, individualized risk assessment and counseling, assistance with partner notification, and periodic screening for common sexually transmitted infections. For high-risk, HIV-uninfected patients, administer preexposure prophylaxis with daily emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and provide multimodal interventions (eg, individualized counseling on risk reduction). Provide intravenous/injection drug users with multimodal harm reduction services such as access to needle/syringe exchange programs, supervised injection, medically assisted therapies, and detoxification programs. Administer prompt postexposure prophylaxis in individuals with mucosal/parenteral HIV exposure from a known infected source. Consultations Consultation with an infectious disease or HIV specialist should be strongly considered for all new cases of HIV infection. Studies have clearly shown that the successful management of patients with HIV is related to the expertise and HIV caseload of the treating physician. In particular, pediatric cases of HIV infection are handled differently; cutoffs for CD4 counts at which prophylaxis would be recommended and antiviral drug availability (on- or off-study for experimental drugs or regimens) differ on the basis of age. Input from an infectious disease consultant may be helpful in the management of other unrelated illnesses in patients infected with HIV. Long-Term Monitoring Guidelines from the DHHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents recommend performing the following tests every 3 months in patients on antiretroviral therapy [ 5]  : Basic chemistry profile Liver function studies Complete blood count with differential The basic chemistry studies should include serum sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine, and glucose (preferably fasting), plus an estimate of creatinine clearance. Fasting glucose is repeated every 3-6 months if abnormal at the last measurement, or every 6 months if normal at the last measurement. A fasting lipid profile is measured every 6 months if abnormal at the last measurement, or every 12 months if normal at the last measurement. In a clinically stable patient on an regimen whose viral load is suppressed and whose CD4 +  T-cell count is well above the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, 2011 DHHS guidelines recommend that the CD4 +  T-cell count may be monitored every 6-12 months (instead of every 3-6 months), unless there are changes in the patient’s clinical status, such as new HIV-associated clinical symptoms or initiation of treatment with interferon, corticosteroids, or anti-neoplastic agents. [ 5]  Differential Diagnoses Diagnostic Considerations Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should be considered in any patient with unusual or recurrent serious infections without another cause, especially in those with risk factors for HIV infection. Any of the opportunistic infections or cancers associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can also occur in the absence of HIV infection, although they usually develop in patients with some other form of immune suppression or defect. The possibility of HIV infection must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Other causes of immune suppression (eg, chemotherapy, immune disorders, severe combined immune deficiency [SCID], severe malnutrition) should be considered. For example, a young adult with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy is at high risk for many opportunistic infections. Burkitt Lymphoma Candidiasis Coccidioidomycosis and Valley Fever Cryptococcosis Cryptosporidiosis Cytomegalovirus Herpes Simplex High-Grade Malignant Immunoblastic Lymphoma Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) (Mycobacterium Avium-Intracellulare [MAI]) Toxoplasmosis Medication Medication Summary Effective antiretroviral therapy is the most important intervention in terms of improving longevity and preventing opportunistic infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Therapy should involve combinations of drugs—two nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors combined with either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside–analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. [ 5,  154]  Antiretroviral drug classes and agents within each class are listed in Table 1, below (see individual medication tables for more detail). Nearly 30 antiretroviral drugs have been approved for use in HIV-infected adults and adolescents; 18 of these have an approved pediatric treatment indication and 15 are available as a pediatric formulation or capsule size. Of the 28 antiretroviral drugs that have been approved, 3 are no longer being manufactured either because of the development of improved formulations (ie, amprenavir replaced by fosamprenavir) or because of limited use (ie, delavirdine and zalcitabine [ddC]). Several combination products that contain tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are now approved in the United States. TAF is a more targeted form of tenofovir that has demonstrated high antiviral efficacy at a dose that is 10 times lower than that of tenofovir DF, as well as an improved renal and bone safety profile. Table 1. Antiretroviral Drug Classes and Agents Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Abacavir (Ziagen, ABC) Didanosine (Videx, Videx EC, ddI) Emtricitabine (Emtriva, FTC) Lamivudine (Epivir, 3TC) Stavudine (Zerit, Zerit XR, d4T) Tenofovir DF (Viread, TDF) Tenofovir AF (TAF) Zalcitabine (Hivid, ddC)* Zidovudine (Retrovir, ZDV, AZT) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Amprenavir (Agenerase, AVP)* Atazanavir (Reyataz , ATV) Darunavir (Prezista, DRV) Fosamprenavir (Lexiva, f-APV) Indinavir (Crixivan, IDV) Lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra, LPV/r) Nelfinavir (Viracept, NFV) Ritonavir (Norvir, RTV) Saquinavir (Invirase [hard gel] capsule, SQV) Tipranavir (Aptivus, TPV) Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Delavirdine (Rescriptor, DLV) Efavirenz (Sustiva, EFV) Etravirine (Intelence, ETR) Nevirapine (Viramune, NVP) Rilpivirine (Edurant) Fusion inhibitors Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon, T-20) Cellular chemokine receptor (CCR5) antagonists Maraviroc (Selzentry, MVC) Integrase inhibitors Raltegravir (Isentress, RAL) Dolutegravir (Tivicay, DTG) Elvitegravir (Vitekta, EVG) *No longer available on market Combination therapy has been shown to dramatically reduce the likelihood of drug resistance (many drug-resistant mutations are mutually exclusive) and to suppress viral replication to the point that progression to AIDS is significantly slowed. Antiviral-resistance mutations often affect more than one drug simultaneously because of similar development pipelines and the ultimate molecular structure of the drug, and combination choices should account for this possibility. Ritonavir, a PI that may be used in its own right, boosts blood levels of other PIs. This permits a reduced dosage of the coadministered drug. Various products have been formulated to include PIs combined with ritonavir. Combination products Numerous antiretroviral combination products are available on the market to assist patients with compliance and decrease the daily number of tablets and capsules required (see Table 2, below).

A subgroup analysis of black patients with HIV enrolled in the 48-week, open-label SPIRIT (Switching PI to Rilpivirine In-combination with Truvada) trial showed that switching from an antiretroviral regimen consisting of a boosted PI and ritonavir (RTV) plus 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (PI+RTV+2NRTIs) to a simplified once-daily, single-tablet regimen of rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (RPV/FTC/TDF) is safe and effective in this population. [ 155,  156]  Patients were randomized to undergo an immediate switch to RPV/FTC/TDF at baseline or to maintain their PI+RTV+2NRTIs regimen for 24 weeks and then switch to RPV/FTC/TDF for 24 weeks (delayed switch). At 24 weeks, a subgroup analysis of black patients in the study showed that viral suppression rates (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were 95% in the RPV/FTC/TDF group and 91% in the group receiving PI+RTV+2NRTIs; ie, no significant difference existed. At 48 weeks, 89% of black patients in the immediate-switch group maintained viral suppression, compared with 95% of those in the delayed-switch group, which again was not considered a significant difference. [ 155,  156]  At 48 weeks, when all patients in the study were taken into account, there was no significant difference in viral suppression between the immediate-switch (89%) and delayed-switch (92%) groups; the rates of adverse events were similar in both groups as well. [ 155,  156]  However, investigators noted significant improvement in lipid levels in patients who received the single-tablet RPV/FTC/TDF regimen. [ 156]  The FDA has approved a once-daily, fixed-dose triple-combination pill (Triumeq) containing the antivirals dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine for the treatment of patients aged 18 years or older with HIV infection. The FDA based its approval primarily on the results of 2 studies, in one of which, a 96-week study in treatment-naive adults, virologic suppression occurred in 80% of patients receiving dolutegravir and abacavir/lamivudine (administered separately), compared with 72% of patients taking a single-pill regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir (Atripla). [ 157]  Antiretroviral agent, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor Class Summary NRTIs agents inhibit viral replication by inhibiting viral RNA–dependent DNA polymerase. Abacavir (Ziagen) This NRTI interferes with HIV viral RNA–dependent DNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication. In its 2011 guidelines, the Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV Infection recommends screening for HLA-B*5701 before starting patients on a regimen that contains abacavir, to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reaction. [ 6]  Didanosine (Videx, Videx EC) Didanosine interferes with HIV viral RNA–dependent DNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication. Emtricitabine (Emtriva) This agent is a synthetic nucleoside cytosine analog classified as an NRTI. It competes with deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate and incorporates into viral DNA, causing chain termination.  Lamivudine (Epivir) Lamivudine is a thymidine analog that inhibits viral replication. Stavudine (Zerit, Zerit XR) Stavudine competes with deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate and incorporates into viral DNA, causing chain termination. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) This agent inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. It is administered as the prodrug bis-isopropoxycarbonyloxymethyl ester derivative of tenofovir, which is converted, through various enzymatic processes, to tenofovir, a nucleotide analog of adenosine 5'-monophosphate. Bioavailability is enhanced by a high-fat meal. Prolonged intracellular distribution allows for once-daily dosing. This drug has shown substantial efficacy and safety in PReP trials with IV drug users and heterosexually active adults. CDC guidelines recommend tenofovir alone as an alternative regimen to emtricitabine/tenofovir for these populations, but not for MSM, among whom its efficacy has not been studied.  Zidovudine (Retrovir) Zidovudine is a thymidine analog that inhibits viral replication. Antiretroviral Agent, Protease Inhibitor Class Summary PIs inhibit protein precursors necessary for HIV infection of uninfected cells. Atazanavir (Reyataz) An azapeptide HIV-1 PI, atazanavir prevents virion maturation by selectively inhibiting Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1–infected cells.  Darunavir (Prezista) This HIV-1 PI selectively inhibits HIV-encoded Gag-Pol polyprotein cleavage in infected cells, thereby preventing mature virus particle formation. It is indicated for HIV disease that has not responded to treatment with other antiretroviral agents. Coadminister with low-dose ritonavir (ritonavir-boosted therapy decreases elimination and increases darunavir serum concentration). Darunavir is typically coadministered with other anti-HIV agents (eg, NRTIs). Food increases maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). This agent is indicated for HIV infection in antiretroviral treatment–experienced adults (eg, those with HIV-1 strains resistant to more than one PI). Fosamprenavir (Lexiva) Fosamprenavir is a prodrug that is converted to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in vivo. Lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) Lopinavir inhibits HIV protease and renders the enzyme incapable of processing polyprotein precursor, leading to production of noninfectious immature HIV particles. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A metabolism of lopinavir, increasing plasma levels of lopinavir.  Nelfinavir (Viracept) Nelfinavir inhibits HIV-1 protease, resulting in the production of an immature and noninfectious virus. Indinavir (Crixivan) Indinavir prevents formation of protein precursors necessary for HIV infection of uninfected cells and viral replication. Ritonavir (Norvir) This HIV PI is used as a part of double or triple therapy with nucleosides and other protease inhibitors. Saquinavir (Invirase) Saquinavir inhibits HIV protease and renders the enzyme incapable of processing polyprotein precursor, leading to production of noninfectious immature HIV particles. Tipranavir (Aptivus) A nonpeptidic PI that inhibits HIV replication. Indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment in adults with HIV-1 infection who have evidence of viral replication and who are highly experienced with treatment or who have HIV-1 strains that are resistant to multiple PIs. Tipranavir must be coadministered with ritonavir (200 mg) to attain therapeutic levels (ie, tipranavir/ritonavir). Administration alone, without ritonavir-boosted levels, is not effective. Genotypic or phenotypic testing and/or treatment history should guide use. Antiretroviral agent, non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor Class Summary NNRTIs inhibit viral replication. Delavirdine (Rescriptor) An NNRTI of HIV-1, delavirdine directly binds to reverse transcriptase and inhibits RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Efavirenz (Sustiva) Efavirenz is an NNRTI with activity against HIV-1. This agent binds to reverse transcriptase and blocks RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, including HIV-1 replication. Efavirenz does not require intracellular phosphorylation for antiviral activity.  Etravirine (Intelence) Etravirine is an NNRTI of HIV-1 that binds directly to reverse transcriptase, causing catalytic site disruption. This action blocks RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities. Etravirine does not inhibit human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or gamma. This agent is indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for treatment-experienced HIV-infected adults who have viral replication and HIV-1 strains resistant to NNRTIs and other antiretroviral agents. If virologic failure was experienced with other NNRTIs, do not use etravirine in combination with NRTIs only.  Nevirapine (Viramune) Nevirapine is an NNRTI that limits virus replication by a mechanism different from the nucleosidase inhibitors such as zidovudine and lamivudine.  Rilpivirine (Edurant) Rilpivirine is a NNRTI that inhibits HIV-1 replication by noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma.  Antiretroviral Agent, Integrase Inhibitor Class Summary This agent prevents insertion of a DNA copy of the viral genome into host cell DNA. It is indicated for HIV-1 infection combination therapy in treatment-experienced adults with evidence of viral replication and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains.  Raltegravir (Isentress) Raltegravir was the first available agent in the class of integrase strand transfer inhibitors. Dolutegravir (Tivicay) Dolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that inhibits catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV encoded enzyme required for viral replication. It is approved for use in children 12 years or older who weigh at least 40 kg.  Elvitegravir (Vitekta) Integrase inhibitor that is used in combination with an HIV protease inhibitor (ie, atazanavir, lopinavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, or tipranavir) and coadministered with ritonavir plus other antiretroviral drug(s) as indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults. It was originally approved as part of the combination product elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Stribild).  Antiretroviral Agent, Fusion Inhibitor Class Summary These agents disrupt the ability of HIV to fuse with and infect healthy T cells. Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) This is the first agent in the new anti-HIV class called fusion inhibitors. Indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients who demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy. Enfuvirtide binds to HIV gp41 surface protein, thereby, disrupting the virus's ability to fuse with and infect healthy T cells. In clinical trials, subjects were twice as likely to achieve undetectable HIV-1 plasma levels (eg, < 40 copies/mL) when enfuvirtide was added to antiretroviral optimized regimens than without enfuvirtide added to therapy.  Antiretroviral agent, CCR5 antagonist Class Summary These agents block viral entry into white blood cells via the CCR5 co-receptor. Maraviroc (Selzentry) Maraviroc blocks viral entry via the CCR5 co-receptor into WBCs, reduces viral load, and increases T-cell counts in infection with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (ie, R5 virus). Accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on 24-wk data. This agent is indicated for combination treatment with optimized background therapy in treatment-experienced adults infected with only R5 virus who have evidence of viral replication and have HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple antiretroviral agents.  Antiretroviral Combinations Class Summary Combination products are valuable to patient care and help ensure compliance. Abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine (Trizivir) Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which interferes with HIV viral RNA dependent DNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication. Lamivudine and zidovudine are thymidine analogs that inhibit viral replication.  Abacavir/lamivudine (Epzicom) This is a NRTI combination product. It is indicated in combination with other ART agents (eg, NNRTIs, PIs) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older. It is also indicated in combination with safer sex practices for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in adults at high risk. This indication is based on clinical trials in men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk for HIV-1 infection and in heterosexual serodiscordant couples. CDC guidelines include additional populations (eg, IV drug users, heterosexual individuals at high risk).  Abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (Triumeq) Contains 2 NRTIs (abacavir 600 mg and lamivudine 300 mg) and an integrase strand inhibitor (dolutegravir 50 mg). Dosage modification may be required when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inducers by adding a single-entity evening dose of dolutegravir.  Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF/efavirenz (Atripla) NRTI and NNRTI combination product. Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Stribild) Antiretroviral combination product that provides a complete, once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve adults. Contains an integrase inhibitor and 2 NRTIs plus cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor used as a booster for elvitegravir, a CYP3A4 substrate. Cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates, such as elvitegravir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is shortened by CYP3A-dependent metabolism. Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF (Complera) NRTI and NNRTI combination product. Lamivudine/zidovudine (Combivir) NRTI combination product. Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Truvada) NRTI combination product. Indicated in combination with other ART agents (eg, NNRTIs, PIs) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. It is also approved for pediatric patients who weigh at least 17 kg and can swallow the tablet whole. It is also indicated in combination with safer sex practices for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in adults at high risk. This indication is based on clinical trials in men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk for HIV-1 infection and in heterosexual serodiscordant couples. CDC guidelines include additional populations (eg, IV drug users, heterosexual individuals at high risk). Emtricitabine/tenofovir AF (Descovy) NRTI combination product. Indicated in combination with other ART agents (eg, NNRTIs, PIs) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 y or older. Unlike Truvada, it is not indicated for PrEP. Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir AF (Odefsey) Antiretroviral combination product that provides a complete, once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve adults and adolescents aged ≥12 y, or to replace the current ART regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ART regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure. Each tablet contains 1 NNRTI (rilpivirine 25 mg) and 2 NRTIs (emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir AF 25 mg).

				"body": "Overview The CD4 count is an important indicator of immune function and also guides antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. ART improves survival and reduces complications related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It also helps to reduce inflammation and other complications associated with HIV infection and to reduce HIV transmission. [ 1]  The benefits of ART also include decreased morbidity and mortality. The current recommendation is that all patients with HIV infection undergo ART regardless of CD4 counts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. Recent studies Two large randomized controlled trials (Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy [START] [ 2]  and TEMPERANO [ 3]  ) evaluated the optimal time to initiate ART, and both demonstrated about a 50% reduction in morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts more than 500 cells/µL randomized to receive ART immediately versus delaying initiation of ART. Based on the START and TEMPRANO findings, the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (the Panel) has increased the strength and evidence rating for the recommendation on initiating ART to AI for all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 count. An AI rating is defined as a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence (ie, one or more randomized trials with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints). An ART regimen for treatment-naive patients generally consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in combination with a third active ART drug from one of three drug classes: an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor (PI) with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ie, cobicistat or ritonavir). [ 1]  AIDS-Defining Illness and CD4 Counts When the CD4 cell count is <200 cells/µL, patients are at a greater risk for life-threatening, AIDS-defining, opportunistic infections. [ 4]  Clinical trials have shown that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with a CD4 count <200 cells/µL improves survival and delays disease progression compared with delayed ART. [ 5]  When discussing starting ART, physicians should inform patients that data on the clinical benefit of starting treatment at a CD4 count >500 cells/µL are variable; it is not strong for individual health, but it clearly reduces transmission. [ 1]  Increased Urgency and Special Considerations Increased urgency for ART While antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients with HIV infection, the following conditions increase the urgency to initiate therapy: [ 1]  Pregnancy AIDS-defining conditions Acute opportunistic infections Lower CD4 counts (eg, <200 cells/µL) Rapidly declining CD4 counts (eg, >100 cells/µL decrease per year) Higher viral loads (eg, >100,000 copies/mL) HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) Acute/early HIV infection HIV/hepatitis B virus coinfection HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfection Special considerations when selecting initial therapy Therapy should be individualized and based on factors such as the following: Comorbid conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, chemical dependency, liver disease, psychiatric disease, renal diseases, tuberculosis) Potential adverse drug effects Potential drug interactions with other medications Pregnancy or pregnancy potential Results of genotypic drug-resistance testing Gender and pretreatment CD4 count if considering nevirapine (NVP) HLA-B*5701 testing if considering abacavir (ABC) Coreceptor tropism assay if considering maraviroc (MVC) Patient adherence potential Convenience (eg, pill burden, dosing frequency, food and fluid considerations) Preferred Treatment Regimens Preferred regimens have favorable tolerability and toxicity profiles, are clinically effective, and are characterized by ease of use. An antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen generally consists of 2 NRTIs (one of which is FTC or 3TC) plus an INSTI, NNRTI, or a pharmacokinetic-enhanced PI (ie, PI administered with cobicistat or ritonavir). Note that FTC or 3TC may be used interchangeably in the regimens listed that are not fixed-dose combination products. Regimens that include abacavir are only for patients who are HLA-B*5701 negative.

An alternative regimen may be the preferred regimen for some patients.

				"body": "Practice Essentials The risk of occupational exposure to HIV has resulted in the creation of strategies to reduce the risk in physicians and medical personnel. Such strategies focus on consideration of modes and risk of transmission, baseline and follow-up testing, and prophylaxis. Updated guidelines from the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) and  New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute  recommend that, after any occupational exposure to HIV, healthcare personnel should immediately receive a postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) three-drug regimen. [ 1,  2]  Specific recommendations also include the following: Primary prevention strategies are emphasized, along with prompt reporting and management of occupational exposures. The HIV status of the source of the exposure should be determined to guide the need for HIV PEP; if the HIV status of the source is unknown, it should be determined, usually with a rapid and reliable test such as the fourth-generation HIV test. If there is a concern about a false-negative result (eg, result is negative but there has been a risk for HIV transmission to the source prior to test detection, about 4-10 days for tests that detect Ag and/or Ab, including the fourth-generation test), plasma HIV RNA (HIV viral load) testing of the source is recommended. PEP should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours of exposure; a first dose of PEP should be offered to the exposed worker while the evaluation is underway if HIV transmission is considered credible. A PEP supply for 3-5 days is available for urgent use, and the exposed worker obtains a continuous supply to complete the 28-day course. Follow-up appointments should begin within 72 hours of HIV exposure and should include follow-up HIV testing, monitoring for drug toxicity, and counseling. Repeat HIV testing should be obtained at 6 weeks and 4 months postexposure. Testing should also be performed using the fourth-generation assay or HIV viral load if the injured healthcare worker has symptoms of the acute retroviral syndrome. Updated guidelines should be distributed to emergency physicians and other providers as needed; many healthcare personnel exposures occur outside of normal office hours. Clinicians who do not have access to experienced HIV clinicians should call the National Clinicians' Consultation Center PEP Line at 1-888-448-4911.  Risk factors The risk of HIV transmission after exposure to body fluids from an HIV-infected patient is generally low. Risks associated with the 3 main routes of exposure are as follows: [ 3,  4]  Percutaneous exposure - Risk with an HIV-positive source, approximately 0.3%; risk is increased by hollow-bore needles, visibly bloody devices, deep injuries, and source person with terminal illness reflecting higher titer of HIV Cutaneous exposure (ie, via nonintact skin) - Risk with an HIV-positive source, less than 0.09% Mucous membrane exposure - Risk with an HIV-positive source, approximately 0.09%; risk is increased with a high viral load in the source and large-volume exposure Management of exposure Initial management steps for healthcare personnel exposed to HIV include the following: Immediate decontamination (if not already performed by the healthcare worker) - For percutaneous or cutaneous exposure, washing of the area with soap and water; for mucous membrane exposure, copious irrigation of the area with water or sterile saline; for puncture wounds, cleanse with alcohol-based hand wipes; for eye exposures, irrigation with copious amounts of sterile water or saline Initiation of institutional PEP plan - Reporting of exposure; confirmation of medication availability; provision of the initial supply; authorizing release of the drugs; determination of how the healthcare worker will obtain the medications to complete the 28-day regimen Ordering of blood tests, immediate treatment, and follow-up within 72 hours, at which time further review and evaluation can be carried out Source of exposure - Voluntary testing for HIV, hepatitis C virus antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); if HIV test is positive, confirmatory Western blot; if HIV infection is known to be present, elicitation of relevant information about disease stage Healthcare worker - Testing for HIV, HCV antibody, HBsAg, and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb); in females of child-bearing age, pregnancy testing; if HIV PEP is initiated, baseline complete blood (CBC) count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) When indicated, PEP should be initiated as soon as possible (ideally ≤2 hours and generally ≤72 hours) after exposure. The approach to PEP depends on the type of exposure, the source, and the HIV status of the source. Follow-up measures should include the following: Refraining from donation of blood, tissue, semen, or organs Avoiding sexual intercourse or using barrier precautions; , avoiding breastfeeding; informing the provider if the at-risk healthcare worker is pregnant Follow-up HIV antibody testing at 6 weeks and 4 months Rechecking of CBC, renal function, and hepatic function at 2 and 4 weeks Epidemiology Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that more than 380,000 total percutaneous exposures occur each year. [ 5]  Underreporting of exposures has long been recognized as a significant problem due to the perception of technical incompetence, nature of the intervention, lack of understanding of the risks, and concern about excessive paperwork. [ 6]  Despite a large number of reported exposures, the number of occupationally acquired HIV infections among healthcare workers (HCW) reported to the CDC has been much lower. Between 1985 and 2013, 58 confirmed and 150 possible cases of occupationally acquired HIV infections were reported to the CDC. Only one confirmed case has been reported since 1999. This case involved a laboratory technician working with a live HIV culture in 2008. Nurses accounted for the highest number of confirmed and possible occupationally acquired HIV cases, representing 41.4% and 24.7% of cases, respectively. [ 7]  Modes of Transmission HIV may theoretically be transmitted occupationally to medical personnel engaged in many routine medical procedures and activities. After initial exposure, HIV replicates within dendritic cells of the skin and mucosa before spreading through lymphatic vessels and developing into a systemic infection. This delay in systemic spread leads to a window of opportunity for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) using antiretroviral drugs to block replication of HIV and prevent establishment of chronic HIV infection. A portal of entry (percutaneous, cutaneous, or mucous membrane) is necessary along with exposure to infectious body fluid. Potentially infectious body fluids include blood, semen, vaginal fluids, amniotic fluids, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluid. Exposure to saliva, vomitus, urine, feces, sweat, tears, and respiratory secretions does not pose a risk for HIV transmission unless the fluid is visibly bloody. A bite from an HIV-infected patient with visible bleeding in the mouth that causes bleeding in the healthcare worker is considered an exposure. Splash of blood, visibly bloody fluid, or other potentially infectious material to a mucosal surface (mouth, nose, eyes) is also considered an exposure.  Risk of Transmission The risk of transmission of HIV after exposure to body fluids from an HIV-infected patient is generally low. [ 8]  Typical exposures result from percutaneous exposure to contaminated sharps such as needles, scalpels, and broken glass. Needlesticks such as from a large-bore hollow needle are thought to carry a higher risk of transmission. Other factors for higher risk are detailed in Table 1. Nonintact skin exposures occur when the medical worker has evidence of compromised skin integrity such as an abrasion, dermatitis, or open wound. Intact skin is considered an effective barrier against HIV infection, and contamination by blood or other fluids is not considered an exposure. From a review [ 3]  in the era prior to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the following risks of HIV transmission were found:  Table 1. Risk of Transmission of HIV Route of Exposure Risk with HIV-Positive Source Factors Increasing Risk Percutaneous ≈ 1 in 300 (0.3%) Hollow bore needles, visibly bloody devices, deep injury, source with terminal illness Cutaneous < 1 in 1000 (0.09%) Must involve nonintact skin integrity Mucous membrane ≈ 1 in 1000 (0.09%) High viral load in source Postexposure Management If not already performed by the healthcare worker, immediate decontamination should be done. In the case of a needlestick injury, the area should be washed with soap and water. The wound should not be squeezed or milked or exposed to caustic agents such as bleach. For a cutaneous exposure, the area should be treated similarly with soap and water. In the mucous membrane exposure to blood or body fluids, the area should be copiously irrigated with water or sterile saline. All healthcare institutions should have an easily accessible system in place available 24 hours a day that allows for reporting and managing the healthcare worker who experiences an occupational exposure to HIV. The plan for providing PEP should encompass how the medication will be made available, provision of the initial 24- to 48-hour supply, authority for releasing the drugs, and how the healthcare worker will obtain the PEP medications to complete the 4-week regimen in light of the circumstances that some individuals may be reluctant to go to their local pharmacy. In the United States, a policy for managing exposures is required and must comply with the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA standard 1910.1030 Blood borne Pathogens). Clinicians charged with managing these exposures should have the capability to initiate blood tests, start immediate treatment, and arrange for follow-up within 72 hours. At that time, the opportunity for further clarification of the nature of the exposure, review of source test results, and evaluation of the PEP regimen exists. The source person may know his or her HIV status, and the person’s health records may be readily available. If the source person’s HIV status is unknown, voluntary testing for HIV (preferably the fourth-generation test), HCV Ab, and HBsAg should be performed. If these tests have previously been performed, clinical judgment should be used to determine whether the studies need repeating. Rapid EIA HIV Ab testing is extremely sensitive and specific and, if positive, should be considered a true positive for the purposes of PEP decision-making. A positive rapid test result requires a Western blot confirmatory test. If the rapid HIV test is not available on a timely basis, PEP treatment should be started knowing that it can be stopped if the test yields a negative result. If the source patient has known HIV infection, relevant information about regarding most recent viral load, antiretroviral therapy (ART) history, and the most recent resistance test results should be elicited. If the HIV status of the source in unknown, HIV testing, preferably with the fourth-generation HIV test, as advocated by the CDC, should be performed. This test may return false-negative results during the first 2 weeks of virus transmission. Note that there have been no reported cases of transmission involving an exposure, during this period, although this is a time in which the viral load is especially high, suggesting very high vulnerability. [ 8]  If the source person has been at risk for HIV exposure during the preceding 2 weeks, HIV viral load testing should be considered. Permission for testing should be obtained from the source person. Refusal by the source person for blood draw should be discussed with the local health department for assistance in the matter. Laws and regulations regarding this scenario vary from state to state. For the healthcare worker, baseline laboratory studies include HIV, HCV Ab, HBV surface Ag, and HBV surface Ab. Hepatitis B testing depends on immunization status. Most healthcare personnel have been immunized against hepatitis B. If they know they responded to the vaccination series, they have lifelong immunity and require no further testing. If they are unaware of their response status, HBV surface Ab should be drawn to determine if they have a positive titer. If PEP is being considered and the healthcare worker is a female of childbearing age, an immediate pregnancy test should be performed. If HIV PEP is initiated, a baseline CBC count, BUN, creatinine, and ALT should also be drawn. Timely administration of PEP should not be delayed by drawing blood for laboratory studies. PEP should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours and generally no later than 36 hours after the possible exposure. Decisions regarding initiation of PEP beyond 36 hours postexposure should be made on a case-by-case basis with the realization of diminished efficacy when timing of initiation is prolonged. The sooner the medications are started, the more effective they may be. [ 9]  PEP is recommended when an exposure to an HIV-positive patient has occurred. PEP is generally not warranted in cases of unknown status, but this can be considered from a source with HIV risk factors. If the source person is unknown (sharps box injury), PEP is generally not warranted but can be considered when exposure to HIV-infected persons is likely.  PEP Regimen Three-drug PEP regimens are now the recommended regimens for all exposures owing to the safety and tolerability of new HIV drugs. The guidelines no longer require assessing the severity of exposure. There are some special circumstances, however, in which a 2-drug regimen can be used, especially when recommended antiretroviral medications are unavailable or there is concern about potential adherence problems or toxicity. An expert should be consulted if a 2-drug PEP regimen is being considered. The preferred HIV 3-drug PEP regimen is raltegravir (Isentress) 400 mg PO twice daily  plus  Truvada (tenofovir DF 300 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg) 1 PO once daily The 2016 guidelines for antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis for nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommend either raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily or dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg daily in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg daily as the preferred regimen in healthy adults and adolescents. [ 10]  Dolutegravir provides a reasonable once-daily alternative to raltegravir. (This ART regimen is not in the 2013 postoccupational exposure to HIV guidelines since it was FDA-approved after the PEP guidelines were written but is favored by most authorities.) A 2016 randomized prospective noninferiority study of ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) versus the standard of care (SOC) for HIV PEP concluded that DRV/r should be included as a standard component of recommended regimens in PEP guidelines. The recommendation was based on the tolerability and safety profile of DRV/r. [ 11]  Table 2.

For PEP, the selection of dosing and schedule is to optimize adherence while minimizing side effects where possible. This table includes the preferred dosing schedule for each agent, and in all cases with the exception of Kaletra the once-daily regimen option is preferred for PEP. Twice-daily administration of Kaletra is better tolerated with respect to GI toxicities compared with the once-daily regimen. Alternative dosing and schedules may be appropriate for PEP in certain circumstances and should preferably be prescribed by individuals experienced in the use of antiretroviral medications. Follow-up of Exposed Healthcare Worker PEP is given for 28 days. If source person testing is negative for HIV, PEP can be stopped before 28 days. During the follow-up period, especially the first 6-12 weeks, exposed healthcare workers should undertake precautions to prevent further transmission of HIV. They should not donate blood, tissue, semen, or organs. They should not engage in sexual intercourse, become pregnant, or breastfeed. Follow-up HIV Ab testing should be performed at 6 weeks and 4 months. A negative result at 12 weeks reasonably excludes HIV infection related to the occupational exposure. Routine testing at 6 months postexposure is no longer recommended. Symptoms of acute HIV (fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, rash, flu-like symptoms, and weight loss) should prompt immediate evaluation. For patients who receive PEP, CBC, renal, and hepatic function should be rechecked at 2 and 4 weeks.  Table 3. Monitoring Recommendations After Initiation of PEP Regimens Following Occupational Exposure a [ 12]    Baseline Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 12 Clinic visit √ √ Or by telephone √ Or by telephone √ Or by telephone √   Pregnancy test √           Serum liver enzymes, BUN, creatinine, CBC count b √   √   √   HIV test c √       √ √ a  See also  Hepatitis C  and  Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) . b  CBC count should be obtained in all exposed workers at baseline; a follow-up CBC count is indicated only in those receiving a zidovudine-containing regimen. c  Recommended even if PEP is declined. Adverse effects are generally self-limited but sometimes can last the duration of the 28-day PEP course. Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are most common. Headache, fatigue, and insomnia are other adverse effects. Antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications can be prescribed to help with PEP adherence. If adverse effects are severe, consider changing to a different regimen. Toxicities are rare with the current preferred PEP regimens, generally not life-threatening, and reversible. Because of the complexity and potential adverse drug effects, follow-up visits should be with an experienced occupational health clinician or HIV specialist. There is no need to modify the patient care responsibilities of the exposed healthcare worker.  PEP for the Pregnant or Breastfeeding Medical Worker As with all medications, the risks and benefits of PEP should be discussed with the pregnant medical worker who has sustained an exposure. All pregnant women starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be entered into the  Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry , a database designed to collect information on the outcomes of antiretroviral-exposed pregnancies regardless of HIV status. Most antiretroviral drugs are category B or C. Based on limited data, the benefit of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy, including during the first trimester, outweigh the risks and do not appear to increase the risk of birth defects. Drugs to avoid during pregnancy are well covered in  Antiretroviral Therapy for Pregnant HIV-Infected Patients . Contraindicated medications include efavirenz (which is contraindicated in the first trimester), indinavir, and the combination of didanosine and stavudine. Based on increasing clinical experience with HAART, PEP is indicated at any time during pregnancy when a significant exposure has occurred. [ 13]  Women who may have been exposed to HIV should avoid breastfeeding for 3 months after the exposure. Both HIV and antiretroviral drugs may be found in breast milk.  Further Resources The National Clinicians’ Postexposure Prophylaxis Hotline ( PEPline ) can be contacted at 888-448-4911 daily from 9 am to 2 am EST (6 am to 11 pm PST) for assistance in assessing risk and advice on managing occupational exposures to HIV and other blood borne pathogens.

In addition, the development of tenofovir alafenomide (TAF) as an alternative prodrug to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) means that TAF-containing regimens should supplant TDF-containing regimens in children, due to concerns regarding decreases in bone mineral density with TDF. The exception to his recommendation is in the context of post-exposure prophyalxis, where TAF remains unstudied, and where the lower plasma concentrations of the drug may actually be a disadvantage.   Treatment Guidelines 1 NNRTI + 2 NRTI 1 PI + 2 NRTI 1 INSTI + 2 NRTI NNRTI non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor preferred, ≥ 3 yrs: efavirenz preferred, ≥ 3 yrs: nevirapine alternative:nevirapine PI protease inhibitor preferred: lopinavir + ritonavir alternative, ≥ 6 yrs: atazanavir + ritonavir (low dose), fosamprenavir + ritonavir (low dose) alternative, ≥ 2 yrs: nelfinavir INSTI Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor preferred, >2yo to 12yo; raltegravir chewables or film-coated tablets preferred, >12yo and >40mg: dolutegravir preferred, ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥35 kg: elvitegravir ONLY in the fixed dose combination elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF alternative, 4 weeks to 2yo: raltegravir granules Dual-NRTI nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor preferred: abacavir + (lamivudine or emtricitabine), didanosine + emtricitabine, tenofovir + (lamivudine or emtricitabine), zidovudine + (lamivudine or emtricitabine) alternative: abacavir + zidovudine, zidovudine + didanosine ",

				"body": "Overview Practice Essentials Since the first cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were identified, the number of children infected with HIV has risen dramatically in developing countries, the result of an increased number of HIV-infected women of childbearing age in these areas. HIV is a retrovirus and can be transmitted vertically, sexually, or via contaminated blood products or IV drug abuse. Vertical HIV infection occurs before birth, during delivery, or after birth. The genome layouts of HIV-1 and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) are shown in the image below. Genome layout of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 and HIV-2.  Genome layout of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 and HIV-2.  Essential update: Study suggests benefits to starting HAART earlier in HIV-infected children In a study of HIV-1-infected, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naive children, Yin et al found that beginning HAART at younger ages and healthier CD4 levels results in better immune recovery. [ 1,  2]  In all, 72% of children who were immunosuppressed at baseline recovered to normal within 4 years after initiating HAART therapy. Compared with children with severe immunosuppression, more children with mild immunosuppression (+36%) or advanced immunosuppression (+20.8%) recovered a normal CD4 percentage. For every 5-year increase in baseline age, the proportion of children who achieved a normal CD4 percentage fell by 19%. [ 2]  Combining age effects and baseline CD4 percentage resulted in more than 90% recovery when HAART was initiated in children with mild immunosuppression at any age or advanced immunosuppression at an age younger than 3 years. Most of the immunologic benefits of HAART remained significant at 4 years. Signs and symptoms History Signs and symptoms of pediatric HIV infection include the following: Unusually frequent and severe occurrences of common childhood bacterial infections, such as otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia Recurrent fungal infections, such as candidiasis (thrush), that do not respond to standard antifungal agents: Suggests lymphocytic dysfunction Recurrent or unusually severe viral infections, such as recurrent or disseminated herpes simplex or zoster infection or cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis; seen with moderate to severe cellular immune deficiency Growth failure Failure to thrive Wasting Failure to attain typical milestones: Suggests a developmental delay; such delays, particularly impairment in the development of expressive language, may indicate HIV encephalopathy Behavioral abnormalities (in older children), such as loss of concentration and memory, may also indicate HIV encephalopathy Physical examination Signs and symptoms of pediatric HIV infection found during physical examination include the following: Candidiasis: Most common oral and mucocutaneous presentation of HIV infection Thrush in the oral cavity and posterior pharynx: Observed in approximately 30% of HIV-infected children Linear gingival erythema and median rhomboid glossitis Oral hairy leukoplakia Parotid enlargement and recurrent aphthous ulcers Herpetic infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV): May manifest as herpes labialis, gingivostomatitis, esophagitis, or chronic erosive, vesicular, and vegetating skin lesions; the involved areas of the lips, mouth, tongue, and esophagus are ulcerated HIV dermatitis: An erythematous, papular rash; observed in about 25% of children with HIV infection Dermatophytosis: Manifesting as an aggressive tinea capitis, corporis, versicolor, or onychomycosis Pneumocystis jiroveci  (formerly  P carinii ) pneumonia (PCP): Most commonly manifests as cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, and fever Lipodystrophy: Presentations include peripheral lipoatrophy, truncal lipohypertrophy, and combined versions of these presentations; a more severe presentation occurs at puberty Digital clubbing: As a result of chronic lung disease Pitting or nonpitting edema in the extremities Generalized cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy See  Clinical Presentation  for more detail. Diagnosis Detection of antibody to HIV is the usual first step in diagnosing HIV infection. The 2010 Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children [ 3]  recommendations for diagnosing infants include the following: Because of the persistence of the maternal HIV antibody, infants younger than 18 months require virologic assays that directly detect HIV in order to diagnose HIV infection Preferred virologic assays include HIV bDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and HIV RNA assays. The HIV PCR DNA qualitative test is usually less expensive. Further virologic testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 4 months An antibody test to document seroreversion to HIV antibody–negative status in uninfected infants is no longer recommended. In older children and adults, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect HIV antibody, followed by a confirmatory Western blot (which has increased specificity), should be used to diagnose HIV infection. Rapid HIV tests, which provide results in minutes, simplify and expand the availability of HIV testing. Their sensitivity is as high as 100%, but they must be followed with confirmatory Western blotting or immunofluorescence antibody testing, as with conventional HIV antibody tests. See  Workup  for more detail. Management Appropriate ART and therapy for specific infections and malignancies are critical in treating patients who are HIV positive. Classes of antiretroviral agents include the following: Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Fusion inhibitors CCR5 coreceptor antagonists (entry inhibitors) HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors Combination ART with at least 3 drugs from at least 2 classes of drugs is recommended for initial treatment of infected infants, children, and adolescents because it provides the best opportunity to preserve immune function and delay disease progression. Drug combinations for initial therapy in ART-naive children include a backbone of 2 NRTIs plus 1 NNRTI or 1 PI. Pediatric HIV experts agree that infected infants who have clinical symptoms of HIV disease or evidence of immune compromise should be treated. [ 3]  Patients aged 1 year or older with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or significant symptoms should be aggressively treated regardless of CD4 +  percentage and count or plasma HIV RNA level. In addition to antiretroviral drugs (ARDs), other types of medication are required as appropriate for specific infections or malignancies. For example,  P jiroveci  pneumonia prophylaxis is recommended in patients who are HIV positive and younger than 1 year and in older children based on CD4 +  counts. See  Treatment  and  Medication  for more detail. Background Over the past 30 years, since the first cases of what is now recognized as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were identified in 1981, the number of children infected with HIV has increased dramatically in developing countries because the number of HIV-infected women of childbearing age has risen. However, great advances have been made in the United States and in other industrialized nations to control transmission of the virus from mother to infant. In the United States, universal prenatal HIV testing has been recommended to obstetricians since 1995. However, this testing was not mandatory in all states. Before prenatal testing was common, diagnosing HIV infections in a woman after diagnosing it in her child was not unusual, and the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a previously healthy child was not rare. Before 1985, one way in which children were infected was the transfusion of blood-products. Improved screening tests have essentially eliminated such transmission. A common way adolescents become infected is by engaging in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sexual intercourse and injection drug abuse. Surveillance data now show that the only group with increasing HIV incidence is men who have sex with men. The proportion of this population who are unaware of their infection is high, with unawareness among young men (18-29 y) reaching 63%. [ 4]  In the United States, youths aged 13-24 years accounted for 25.7% of new HIV infections in 2010. [ 5]  In pediatric patients, HIV infection progresses as it does in adults, although surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that patients who are aged 13-24 years when diagnosed with AIDS survive longer than older individuals do. Vertically transmitted HIV can cause rapidly progressive, chronically progressive, or adultlike disease in which a significant clinical latency period occurs before symptoms appear. The  World Health Organization  (WHO) [ 6]  estimates that approximately 2.5 million children were living with HIV infection as of 2009. In 2009 alone, 370,000 children were newly infected. [ 7]  This is a drop of 24% from 5 years earlier. [ 8]  Not only are the children themselves ravaged by disease, but their primary caregivers have also often succumbed to AIDS. This is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 11.6 million children had been orphaned by AIDS as of 2007. Although 2 strains of HIV have currently been identified, most patients who have AIDS are positive for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) or are positive for both HIV-1 and HIV type 2 (HIV-2). HIV-2 infection is most commonly observed in West Africa. Vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is the main route by which childhood HIV infection is acquired; the risk of perinatal acquisition is 25-40% without intervention. [ 9]  Perinatal transmission of infection by the mother accounts for 80% of pediatric HIV disease cases in the United States. Perinatal transmission can occur in utero, during the peripartum period, and from breastfeeding. Other routes of transmission, such as transfusion of blood and blood components, are rare in the United States but still exist in developing countries. Sexual abuse of children and high-risk behaviors in adolescents also contribute to youth HIV infection. A variety of signs and symptoms should alert the clinician to the possibility of HIV infection in a child. The presentations include recurrent bacterial infections, unrelenting fever, unrelenting diarrhea, unrelenting thrush, recurrent pneumonia, chronic parotitis, generalized lymphadenopathy, delay in development with failure to thrive, and significant pruritic dermatoses. Mucocutaneous eruptions may be the first sign of HIV infection and may vary in presentation, depending on the child's immune status. For information on HIV infection in adults and adolescents, see  HIV Disease . Pathophysiology HIV can be transmitted vertically, sexually, or via contaminated blood products or IV drug abuse. Vertical HIV infection occurs before birth, during delivery, or after birth. With infection before birth (period 1), the fetus can be hematologically infected by means of transmission across the placenta or across the amniotic membranes, especially if the membranes are inflamed or infected. Most vertical infections occur during delivery (period 2), and many factors affect the risk of infection during this period (see Deterrence/Prevention). In general, the longer and the greater amount of contact the neonate has with infected maternal blood and cervicovaginal secretions, the greater the risk of vertical transmission. Premature and low-birthweight neonates appear to have an increased risk of infection during delivery because of their reduced skin barrier and immunologic defenses. Postnatal vertical transmission (period 3) occurs with the ingestion of HIV in the breast milk. HIV virology HIV is a retrovirus. Structurally, a lipid bilayer envelope surrounds the cylindrical core of HIV, which contains the RNA genetic information and the machinery that promotes viral replication and integration during initial cellular infection. From the outside, the virion appears spherical, with a diameter of 110 nm. HIV has a variety of structural and nonstructural proteins that determine the interaction of the virus with the host's immune system and cellular components. The genome layouts of HIV-1 and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) are shown in the image below. Genome layout of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 and HIV-2.  Genome layout of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–1 and HIV-2.  The HIV virus attaches to the host cell by the association of a surface glycoprotein to the CD4 molecule; therefore, it primarily infects CD4 +  lymphocytes and macrophages. After HIV enters a host, trimeric gp120 glycoproteins that protrude from its lipoprotein bilayer envelope bind to CD4 cell-surface receptors and CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine co-receptors. Juxtapositioned co-receptors are needed for viral infection. The V3 region of the gp120 glycoprotein determines cellular tropism, and tropism is involved in syncytial formation. M-tropic (nonsyncytial) strains prefer the CCR5 co-receptor and are the primary causes of infection. Deficiency of CCR5 chemokine co-receptors is present in as many as 10% of Europeans and 20% of Ashkenazi Jews, and it appears to confer some protection against infection. After gp120 binds to the receptors, an associated gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein is inserted into the cell membrane and initiates cell-membrane fusion. Upon entering the cell, the protease enzyme produces the reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease (RNAse) H enzymes responsible for synthesizing the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules and primers necessary to produce the complementary DNA strand. Because reverse transcriptase lacks proofreading capacity, considerable base-to-base variability results. The high mutation rate, combined with the high reproductive rate, results in substantial evolution and subsequent resistance to treatment. Once the virus core enters the cell cytoplasm of the host, viral reverse transcriptase copies viral RNA to the DNA of the host. The viral DNA is then transported into the nucleus and incorporated into the DNA of that cell. If activated, viral expression can result in new viral RNA and proteins. New viral core proteins, enzymes, and viral RNA molecules can induce budding, with additional cell infection. Immune response Acute infection rapidly increases the viral load and causes a mild-to-moderate viremia. Although viral loads tend to diminish rapidly after acute infection in adults, they decrease slowly in vertically infected children and may not reach baseline levels until age 4-5 years. Although infants possess numerous antigen-presenting and effector cells compared with adults, their cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity are reduced. Envelope-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are less common in children who vertically acquire the disease than in children who acquire HIV by means of blood transfusion. Among those with vertically acquired disease, such lymphocytes are least common in those with rapidly progressing disease. Precursors of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte that are specific to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) do not develop in significant number until the child is aged 1 year. In adults, antibodies to gp120 develop several months after the initial viremia occurs. The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies is associated with slowed disease progression in adults, children, and infants. The reduction in cell-mediated immunity and secondary B-cell dysfunction result in the immunocompromised state and in the proliferation of opportunistic infections and malignancies. An elevated level of activation-induced cell death resulting from apoptosis of T cells occurs in patients who are HIV positive. The CD95/Fas receptor/ligand system is necessary for the apoptosis of T cells, and abnormalities in this system are linked with increased T-cell death in patients who are HIV positive. As the immune status deteriorates, an increase in CD95 +  T cells is found; conversely, a low CD95 +  T-cell count is found in asymptomatic patients who are HIV positive. Hematopoietic effects Although HIV infects hematopoietic stem cells, the importance is minor. Hematopoietic disturbances are believed to occur as a consequence of changes in the microenvironment of the marrow and of deficiencies in local and systemic growth factors. In typical conditions, the stroma of the marrow promotes stem cell proliferation and differentiation by producing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-3. HIV-infected stroma produces less G-CSF and IL-3 than normal and produces excessive tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IFN-gamma. This cytokine dysregulation halts the production of badly needed hematopoietic cell lines and causes apoptosis of committed progenitor cells. HIV also appears to retard the production of thrombopoietin in the liver and erythropoietin in the kidney. In addition to a low serum erythropoietin level, HIV-induced anemia is also a result of a blunted response to erythropoietin. Thrombocytopenia occurs in 40% of patients with HIV infection during the course of the disease. It is most common in people with advanced disease, those who use IV drugs, African Americans, and those with a history of anemia or lymphoma. The presence of thrombocytopenia suggests a shortened survival time. Immune thrombocytopenia may occur in half of the cases and appears to be the result of molecular mimicry of the platelet glycoprotein (GP)-IIb/IIIa receptor by the HIV-GP 160/120 antigen. Decreased platelet production is common in HIV infection regardless of the platelet count, and it may be associated with the ultrastructural damage in HIV-infected megakaryocytes. Anemia may be present in as many as 20% of patients at the time of diagnosis, and it occurs in as many as 80% of patients at some point. Patients with clinical AIDS are more likely than others to have anemia, as are patients with low CD4 +  counts. The etiology is probably multifactorial in most patients. Common contributing factors are bone marrow suppression, iatrogenic causes, vitamin deficiencies, suppressed erythropoietin production, and a blunted erythropoietin response. Bone marrow infiltration with lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma may be noted. Bone marrow suppression may be due to pathogens such as MAC, parvovirus B19, or CMV. Disseminated fungemia can cause anemia. Neutropenia is observed in 10% of patients with early asymptomatic HIV infections and in 50% of patients with AIDS. Neutropenia results from the aforementioned mechanisms, as well as from medication. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF deficiencies not only reduce neutrophil production but also reduce granulocytic and monocytic function. GM-CSF and G-CSF promote increased neutrophilic function, including superoxide production, phagocytosis, intracellular killing, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Neurologic effects HIV exhibits tropism for the CNS, especially the microglia. As many as 10% of children with AIDS have progressive encephalopathy. Progressive white matter degeneration and brain atrophy may develop. Neurologic symptoms develop along with developmental delay. Viral resistance In terms of the mechanisms of resistance development, the rapid turnover rate and high error rate of reverse transcriptase induces 3300 new single mutations per day. When a mutation improves the survival of the virus in an existing drug environment, that quasispecies is selected to reproduce. The higher the viral load and the higher the rate of replication, the greater the number of resistant quasispecies. Quasispecies can be transmitted to a fetus or neonate. HIV resistance develops because of low antiretroviral drug (ARD) levels due to several factors including variations in drug absorption and metabolism and noncompliance because of adverse effects or a poor understanding of the importance of the medication. Viral sanctuary sites may be exposed to low levels of ARDs, and resistant quasispecies may develop. Etiology Infection is due to HIV, a complex member of the Lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family. HIV-1 is the most common cause of HIV infection in the Americas, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa. HIV-2 has caused epidemics in West Africa, although this virus is also found in European countries. HIV-2 disease progresses more slowly than HIV-1 disease, and HIV-2 is less transmissible than HIV-1. HIV-1 subtypes differ by geographic region. HIV-1 subtype B is predominant in the United States. Non-B subtypes are particularly prevalent in Africa and Asia. The high transmission rate from Africa to Europe has increased the diversity of subtypes in Europe. Non-B subtype HIV-1 infections are increasing in the United States. Vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is the main route by which childhood HIV infection is acquired; the risk of perinatal acquisition is 25%. African epidemiologic data of almost 2000 infants indicate that female infants may be more susceptible to HIV infection before birth and continuing after birth compared with male infants. Epidemiology United States statistics The HIV seroprevalence rate in pregnant women is as high as 0.3%. The seroprevalence of women infected with HIV is highest in the Northeast, followed by the South. Perinatal HIV transmission rates are 25% but as low as 2% in untreated women with viral loads of less than 100 copies/mL. Although prophylactic interventions have reduced vertical transmissions, cases of perinatal HIV transmission continue to occur. [ 10]  This is largely because of missed opportunities for prevention, particularly among women who lack prenatal care or who are not being offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing during pregnancy. In many as 40% of the mothers of infants with perinatally acquired HIV infection, the HIV infection was not known before delivery. The CDC estimates that in 2009, in the 40 states with confidential name-based HIV infection reporting, an estimated 131 infants acquired HIV infection by means of vertical transmission. [ 11]  Estimates place the peak of perinatally-transmitted HIV in the US at 1651 cases in 1991. The CDC estimates that in 2009, in those 40 states, the number of pediatric HIV infections diagnosed was as follows [ 12]  : Under age 13 years: 166 Ages 13-14 years: 21 Ages 15-19 years: 2036 In 2009, 12 cases of perinatally transmitted late HIV disease (AIDS) were diagnosed. The estimated cumulative number of perinatally transmitted AIDS cases diagnosed through 2009 is 8640. At the end of 2008, 3022 children younger than 13 years were living with HIV infection in the 40 states with confidential name-based HIV infection reporting. In the entire United States in 2009, an estimated 13 cases of AIDS were diagnosed in children younger than 13 years. The cumulative estimated number of diagnoses of AIDS in children younger than 13 years through 2009 in the United States is 9448. In the United States, the number of new cases of pediatric AIDS is decreasing, mostly because of public health initiatives regarding universal HIV testing for pregnant women and use of zidovudine and other antiretroviral therapies in infected pregnant women and their newborn infants. In 2007, 19 US children younger than 15 years died of HIV disease. [ 12]  These numbers are in stark contrast to what is occurring internationally. Adolescents and young adults CDC HIV surveillance statistics from 2010 report that 25.7% (approximately 12,200 individuals) of new cases of HIV infection in the United States are in adolescents and young adults aged 13-24 years. Males accounted for 82.8% of new cases of HIV infection among this age group. Of these, 7,000 (57.4%) were African Americans, 2,390 (19.6%) were Latino, and 2,380 (19.5%) were white. Male-to-male sexual contact accounted for 72.1% (8,800 individuals). The percentage of youths tested for HIV infection was 12.9% in high-school students and 34.5% in individuals aged 18-24 years. Testing rates were lower in males than in females. More than half (59.5%) of youths with HIV infection are unaware of their infection. [ 5]  International statistics The WHO estimates that over 33 million individuals are infected with HIV worldwide, and 90% of them are in developing countries. HIV has infected 4.4 million children and has resulted in the deaths of 3.2 million. Each day, 1800 children—the vast majority newborns—are infected with HIV. Approximately 7% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is infected with HIV; these individuals represent 64% of the world's HIV-infected population. Furthermore, 76% of all women infected with HIV live in this region. HIV-1 is the most common cause of HIV infection in the Americas, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa. HIV-1 subtypes differ by geographic region. HIV-1 subtype B is predominant in the United States, though non-B subtype HIV-1 infections are increasing. The HIV seroprevalence rate among pregnant women in South America is 0.3-5%; in sub-Saharan Africa, the range is 13-45%. In Europe, the HIV seroprevalence is greatest in western countries; France, Spain, and Italy have the highest incidences. Pregnant women in urban areas of these countries have a seroprevalence rate as high as 1%. Although the annual number of new HIV infections has been steadily declining since the late 1990s, the epidemics in Eastern Europe and in Central Asia continue to grow; the number of people living with HIV in these regions reached an estimated 1.6 million in 2005—an increase of almost 20-fold in less than 10 years. [ 8]  The overwhelming majority of these people living with HIV are young; 75% of infections reported between 2000 and 2004 were in people younger than 30 years. In Western Europe, the corresponding percentage was 33%. The magnitude of the AIDS epidemic in Asia is significant. Although national HIV infection prevalence rates are low in Asia compared with other continents (notably Africa), the populations of many Asian nations are so large that even low prevalence rates reflect large numbers of people are living with HIV. The seroprevalence rate in pregnant women is already 2%, and the vertical transmission rate is 24% without breastfeeding. Indian mothers infected with HIV routinely breastfeed and have transmission rates as high as 48%. Perinatal transmission rates are relatively low in Europe and high in Africa, independent of treatment. Untreated women infect 13% and 40% of children in Europe and Africa, respectively. The rate of postnatal transmission in Africa and other developing countries is elevated because of the need for breastfeeding. HIV-1 is the most common cause of HIV infection in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. HIV type 2 (HIV-2) has caused epidemics in West Africa, though this virus is also found in European countries. HIV-1 subtypes differ by geographic region. Non-B subtypes are particularly prevalent in Africa and in Asia. The high transmission rate from Africa to Europe has increased the diversity of subtypes in Europe. Globally, children outside the United States are not faring as well. Every day, 1400 children become HIV positive and 1000 children die of HIV-related causes. An estimated 2.5 million children worldwide younger than 15 years are living with HIV/AIDS. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, 1.9 million children are living with HIV/AIDS and more than 60% of all new HIV infections occur in women, infants, or young children. As of 2007, 90% of the newly infected children are infants who acquire HIV from their infected mothers. Alarmingly, 90% of babies who acquire the disease from infected mothers are found in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of HIV infection among undernourished children has been estimated to be as high as 25%. The prevalence of HIV infection in Asia and Europe varies considerably because of varied cultural practices and lack of a national reporting system in many areas. The commercial sex worker industry in countries such as Thailand and in the Caribbean Islands is responsible for increased HIV transmission to young girls and, vertically, to infants. In 2004, more than half a million children younger than 15 years died from HIV/AIDS. In 2006, this number decreased to 380,000. In 2002, HIV/AIDS was the seventh leading cause of mortality in children in developing countries. The disease progresses rapidly in approximately 10-20% of children who are infected, and they die of AIDS by age 4 years, whereas 80-90% survive to a mean age of 9-10 years. In affected regions of sub-Saharan Africa, the infant mortality rate has increased by 75% due, in part, to the orphaned status of most children. In contrast to much of the developed world, the mortality rates for children younger than 5 years are higher today than in 1990 in many African countries, mostly because of the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS. A 2006 South African study estimated that HIV/AIDS is the single largest cause of infant and childhood deaths in rural South Africa. [ 13]  HIV/AIDS is now responsible for 332,000 child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, almost 8% of all child deaths in the region. The results of one study noted that pneumonia and malnutrition are highly prevalent and are significantly associated with high rates of mortality among hospitalized, HIV-infected or HIV-exposed children in sub-Saharan Africa. Other independent predictors of death were septicemia, Kaposi sarcoma, meningitis, and esophageal candidiasis for HIV-infected children; and meningitis and severe anemia for inpatients exposed to HIV. These results stress the importance of expediently establishing therapeutic strategies in African pediatric hospitals. [ 14]  Racial differences in incidence Black and Hispanic children are disproportionately infected in the United States. As of 2002, HIV infection was the 7th and 10th leading cause of death in black children and in Hispanic teens, respectively. [ 15]  Approximately 62% of children with AIDS are black. In the United States, children from minority communities have been most affected by AIDS. More than 50% of infected children are black, and slightly less than 25% are Hispanic. Of the new childhood HIV cases in 2003, 68% occurred in African Americans. The number of pediatric AIDS cases reported in black non-Hispanic children is 3.4 times higher than in white non-Hispanic children and is 2.6 times higher than that of Hispanic children. Sexual differences in incidence Women of childbearing age are one of the fastest growing groups with AIDS; 20% of AIDS cases in adults in the United States occur in this group. Young people (aged 15-44 y) account for one of the fastest growing infected groups and account for almost half of all infections. Among young people, young women are more likely to become infected. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than two thirds of all youth infected are young girls. Variations in frequencies in the sexes in other regions of the world depend on the predominance of commercial sex workers and the proportion of a transient and mobile workforce more likely to be separated from family. Age-related differences in incidence Because vertical transmission from mother to child is the main route by which pediatric HIV infection is acquired, most children who are HIV positive should be identified in infancy. Although current treatment strategies can prevent vertical transmission, the drugs are simply not available in many places, especially in Africa. Nevertheless, the age of presentation can be highly variable in a high-risk child who was previously unidentified. Children can be asymptomatic for many years, and the appearance of an opportunistic infection in a 10-year-old child or in an adolescent in whom AIDS is subsequently diagnosed is not rare. Children who acquire HIV by means of nonvertical transmission may have an illness during the acute phase of the retroviral syndrome, or they may present many years later with opportunistic or recurrent infections. The CDC estimates that 50% of all new HIV infections in the United States occur among individuals aged 13-24 years. This is an important statistic that influences the mortality rates in young adults. For example, HIV is the 5th leading cause of death among black women aged 20-24 years, and it is the principal cause of mortality in black women aged 25-34 years. Prognosis Although HIV infection is usually deadly in children, especially in developing countries, the development of new antiretroviral drugs is promising. The lack of access to antiretroviral agents by children in developing countries is of particular concern. The nutritional status of the child and the diligence with which viral replication is controlled are paramount in determining the outcome of most children with HIV disease. Aggressive treatment of opportunistic infections prevents the more deleterious effects of secondary disease from progressing and further weakening the patient. The social setting and the stressors to which children are exposed have also been linked to the progression of the disease. Hematologic disturbances, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, increase the risk of complications and death. Resolution of anemia improves the prognosis, and treatment of anemia with erythropoietin improves survival. Neutropenia significantly increases the risk of bacterial infection, and treatment of neutropenia with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor substantially decreases the risk of bacteremia and death. Infection with  Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC) hastens death, especially in patients with coexisting anemia (defined as a hematocrit < 25%). The following factors are associated with rapidly progressive disease in infants: Advanced maternal disease High maternal viral load Low maternal CD4 +  count Prematurity In utero transmission High viral load in the first 2 months of life Lack of neutralizing antibodies Presence of p24 antigen AIDS-defining illnesses Early cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection Early neurologic disease Failure to thrive Early-onset diarrhea Each logarithmic decrease in the viral load after the start of therapy decreases the risk of progression by 54%. Baseline CD4 +  T-lymphocyte percentage and associated intermediate-term risk of death in HIV-infected children is as follows [ 16]  : < 5%: 97% 5-9%: 76% 10-14%: 43% 15-19%: 44% 20-24%: 25% 25-29%: 31% 30-34%: 10% ≥35%: 33% Baseline HIV RNA copy number (copies/mL) and associated intermediate-term risk for death in HIV-infected children is as follows [ 16]  : Undetectable (ie, ≤4,000): 24% 4,001-50,000: 28% 50,001- 100,000: 15% 100,001- 500,000: 40% 500,001-1,000,00: 40% 1,000,000: 71% The natural progression of vertically acquired HIV infection appears to have a trimodal distribution. Approximately 15% of children have rapidly progressive disease, and the remainder has either a chronic progressive course or an infection pattern typical of that observed in adults. Mean survival is about 10 years. In resource-poor nations, the progression to death is accelerated. In some instances, close to 45-90% of HIV-infected children died by the age of 3 years. However, among children and adolescents, the start of combination therapy including protease inhibitors reduces the intermediate-term risk of death by an estimated 67%. Also, host genetics play an important role in HIV-1–related disease progression and neurologic impairment The patient's overall progression and prognosis is followed up by using the CDC classification system for children infected with HIV (see Staging). Patient Education Educating parents regarding the importance of compliance with prescribed medications and health care visits is a major challenge because of many factors. See Deterrence/Prevention for further discussion about this topic. Patients should be educated regarding the transmission of HIV. Increasing their awareness of the mechanism and consequences of HIV transmission is important. Safe social interactions that do not expose people to an increased risk for HIV transmission should also be emphasized. For patient education information, see the  Immune System Center  and  Sexually Transmitted Diseases Center , as well as  HIV/AIDS  and  Rapid Oral HIV Test . Clinical Presentation History Ideally, the diagnosis of HIV in a child is made through perinatal testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for recommended testing and counseling for all pregnant women; however, many women, especially in developing countries and in poorer areas of the developed world, do not have access to or do not avail themselves of the resources available. Thus, for example, the diagnosis of HIV infection may follow an investigation of a prolonged or unusual presentation of an infection or a malignancy. Some studies suggest that children vertically infected with HIV become symptomatic from the neonatal period up to age 8 years and that 57% of this group have associated disease within the first year. Children infected as a result of sexual abuse or drug use may not present with known HIV infection. Immunodeficiency should be suspected in individuals with recurrent bacterial infections (especially invasive infections, eg, bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia) and in those with unusual infections, such as those caused by the  Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare  complex (MAC). Children with HIV infection often present with the common bacterial infections of childhood (eg,  otitis media ,  sinusitis ,  pneumonia ). These can be more frequent and more severe than similar infections in immunologically healthy children. Recurrent fungal infections, such as  candidiasis (thrush) , that do not respond to standard antifungal agents suggest lymphocytic dysfunction. Recurrent or unusually severe viral infections, such as recurrent or disseminated herpes simplex or zoster infection or cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, are seen with moderate-to-severe cellular immune deficiency. Growth Growth failure, failure to thrive, or wasting in a child may indicate HIV infection if other common metabolic and endocrine disorders do not appear to be the etiologies. Growth failure, failure to thrive, or wasting in a patient with HIV infection may signify disease progression or underlying malnutrition. Development Failure to attain typical milestones suggests a developmental delay. Such delays, particularly impairment in the development of expressive language, may indicate HIV encephalopathy. The loss of previously attained milestones may signify a CNS insult due to progressive HIV encephalopathy or opportunistic infection. In older children, behavioral abnormalities (eg, loss of concentration and memory) may indicate HIV encephalopathy. Physical Examination A high percentage of oral disease has been seen in children infected with HIV, and oral manifestations are often early indicators of infection. Numerous mucocutaneous disorders have been reported in children infected with HIV. As the CD4 +  count decreases, an increase in the number and severity of skin manifestations can be expected. Dermatologic manifestations occur more frequently in children with advanced HIV disease; many tend to improve after antiretroviral therapy is initiated. The most common oral disease and mucocutaneous presentation of HIV infection is candidiasis caused by  Candida albicans . Both the pseudomembranous variant and the atrophic oral variant are most common. Pseudomembranous candidiasis manifests as creamy white-to-yellow oral plaques, commonly referred to as thrush. Atrophic candidiasis manifests as distinct areas of erythema with the loss of tongue papillae if the tongue is affected. Hyperplastic candidiasis (with both erythematous and white mucosal coloration symmetrically distributed) and angular cheilitis are 2 additional clinical variants of candidiasis. The usual symptoms in children with candidal esophagitis are odynophagia, dysphagia, and retrosternal pain. [ 17]  These symptoms may contribute to the already-compromised nutritional status of the child. An inflammatory, destructive, and necrotic process characterizes candidal periodontal disease in the gingival mucosa and the underlying connective tissue. Although  C albicans  is the most commonly identified  Candida  species,  C dubliniensis  has garnered notice as a cause of oral infection that is seen, for the most part, only in patients who are HIV positive. [ 18]  Other  Candida  species implicated in HIV-related candidiasis are  C glabrata  and  C tropicalis. Candidiasis may manifest as an unresponsive or recurrent diaper rash or as a chronic paronychia and onychomycosis. In  Candida  -associated diaper dermatitis, the area covered by the diaper is usually inflamed and erythematous, with satellite lesions extending beyond the central area of involvement. Involvement of other intertriginous areas, including neck folds and axillary regions, has also been reported. Candidal involvement of the proximal nailfolds causes severe paronychia and nail dystrophy. Candidal onychomycosis results in yellow-brown thickened nail plates. Linear gingival erythema and median rhomboid glossitis have also been found, especially in children with a low CD4 +  cell count. Children infected with HIV have a higher rate of dental caries in the primary teeth but a diminished prevalence in the permanent teeth, a finding attributed to the greater number of primary teeth and the delayed eruption of the permanent teeth in these patients. HIV-infected children should be screened and considered at high risk for dental caries, usually secondary to chronic medication use. [ 19,  20]  Oral hairy leukoplakia, which is associated with Epstein-Barr virus, is usually rare in US children, but it has been reported in children as the second most common oral presentation after candidiasis in some Asian countries. Results from a 2006 Brazilian study suggest that oral hairy leukoplakia may be more common than previously believed; 16.7% of patients demonstrated subclinical, cytological disease, although only 1.7% of children had clinically visible disease. [ 21]  Herpes simplex virus infections, parotid enlargement, and recurrent aphthous ulcers are also common oral manifestations. Dermatophytosis manifesting as an aggressive tinea capitis, corporis, versicolor, or onychomycosis may be challenging to treat. As in adults,  Trichophyton rubrum  infection in the form of proximal, white, subungual onychomycosis is categorized as a typical nail manifestation of HIV disease. Deep fungal infections are not commonly seen in children who are HIV positive. Cryptococcosis, sporotrichosis, and histoplasmosis have been reported as either localized or disseminated variants. Molluscumlike  Cryptococcus  papules have been identified in some patients. Herpetic infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) may take the form of herpes labialis; gingivostomatitis; esophagitis; or as chronic erosive, vesicular, and vegetating skin lesions. The involved areas of the lips, mouth, tongue, and esophagus are ulcerated, which may result in difficulty with oral nutritional intake. Skin lesions usually manifest as chronic erosions, which may have grouped vesicles. The fingers are a frequent site of infection. Pyoderma gangrenosum and ecthyma gangrenosum may be in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous herpetic infections. Recurrent or persistent varicella-zoster infection is strongly linked with the CD4 +  count. Scarring can occur from a severe outbreak, in which lesions may be hyperkeratotic and/or hemorrhagic and involve more than 1 dermatome. Because herpes zoster is usually not seen in children who are immunocompetent, an evaluation for HIV infection should be undertaken in a child with this diagnosis. Children should be evaluated for evidence of dissemination because disastrous sequelae, such as encephalitis, intracranial thrombosis, fulminant hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonitis, and retinal necrosis, have been reported in patients with dissemination. Human papillomavirus infection, which may mimic the tinea versicolor–like rash in epidermodysplasia verruciformis, is noted. Large areas of flat warts most commonly occur on the forehead, the temples, the neck, and the upper body. Unusually large treatment-resistant condylomata are reported in children who are HIV positive. Widespread molluscum contagiosum can occur in pediatric AIDS patients. Molluscum contagiosum may manifest as a diffuse eruption of umbilicated papules involving areas (eg, face) usually not affected in patients who are immunocompetent. Molluscum lesions tend to be more persistent in patients with HIV infection. Some lesions are large and may be confused with  Cryptococcus neoformans  lesions. Molluscum tends to improve with antiretroviral therapy. Recurrent bacterial infections are seen in children who are HIV positive because of the abnormal B-cell response and consequent defective humoral immunity. A variety of bacterial infections occurs, the most common of which is caused by  Staphylococcus aureus.  As the CD4 +  count decreases, invasive bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, may occur. Sepsis, otitis media, impetigo, cellulitis, and furunculosis have been reported. Although the infections may initially manifest in a manner similar to that in a child who is not immunocompromised, widespread and persistent infection should prompt consideration of HIV status. Acral lesions should be sought if sepsis is a concern because a pustule on the sole may be the first sign of sepsis. Atypical presentations, such as plaquelike staphylococcal folliculitis, are also reported. Rare conditions, such as ecthyma gangrenosum as a result of infection by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  are also noted. In this disorder, hemorrhagic necrotic bullae that eventually form a black eschar manifest primarily on the extremities and the gluteal and perineal regions. Bacillary angiomatosis caused by  Bartonella henselae  and  Bartonella quintana  is rare in children but has been reported. [ 22]  Bacillary angiomatosis is considered by some to be an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, typically seen with a CD4 +  count less than 200 cells/μL. Clinically and histologically, the lesions often resemble pyogenic granulomas and Kaposi sarcoma. They often begin as pinpoint papules, which enlarge to become red nodules and usually involve the face or the upper torso. In addition to the cutaneous findings, these patients may have lymphadenopathy, abdominal symptoms, anemia, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Mycobacterial infections caused by  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  and  M avium  complex are increasing in incidence in children who are HIV positive. These children are usually extremely sick. Usually, pulmonary disease is present, but extrapulmonary findings can also occur. Acute pustular eruptions, widespread keratotic papules with hyperkeratotic palms and soles, tuberculous lymphadenitis, purple necrotic lesions, and ulcerations have been reported in HIV-associated mycobacterial infections. M haemophilum  often causes disseminated infection in patients with AIDS. Diffuse swelling and induration of the periarticular soft tissue and nodular formation are reported in patients infected with  M haemophilum. Pneumocystis jiroveci  (formerly  P carinii ) pneumonia (PCP) is the primary AIDS-defining illness and occurs in 7-20% of patients who have not been administered prophylaxis and are younger than 1 year. Most commonly, PCP manifests as cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, and fever. The incidence of PCP is declining in areas where AIDS medications are available, but it continues to shorten life expectancy in areas in which access to antiretrovirals is limited. Scabies in children infected with HIV may progress from a widespread pruritic papular eruption to a crusted variant as the CD4 +  count decreases. This crusted (Norwegian) variant is characterized by an extremely high mite count and thus is very contagious. Secondary bacterial infection may complicate crusted scabies. In regions of the world where measles vaccination is not routinely administered and where HIV is endemic, the potential for serious measles infection exists. [ 7,  23]  Measles typically manifests with an erythematous macular eruption of the trunk with caudal spread. Koplik spots (small blue-white dots surrounded by erythematous rings on the buccal mucosa) are the most common oral manifestation. In children who are immunocompromised, measles may manifest without skin involvement but with more severe complications. Death from pneumonitis and encephalitis has been reported in African children with both HIV infection and measles. Noma (cancrum oris) is a necrotic disease of tissues of the mouth. [ 24]  This disease quickly spreads to surrounding bone and soft tissue and is often associated with immunodeficient states, such as AIDS. Noma predominately occurs in young children from sub-Saharan Africa and is often associated with measles. Seborrheic dermatitis may be a manifestation of HIV in children who present outside of the usual neonatal and adolescent timeframes or who present with generalized disease. An association between  Pityrosporum orbiculare  growth in the presence of waning CD4 +  cells and Langerhans cells has been postulated. The eczematous periorofacial eruption of acrodermatitis enteropathica caused by nutritional deficiency of zinc, secondary to diarrhea-induced malabsorption, has been reported. Other vitamin deficiencies can also be expected because of poor oral intake or diarrhea. Metabolic abnormalities have been reported in association with pediatric HIV disease. Lipodystrophy associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia occurs in children who are HIV positive (similar to adults who are HIV positive) and may be attributed to highly active antiretroviral therapy, although individual variations may make certain children more susceptible. [ 25]  See also  HIV Lipodystrophy . Variations in presentation include peripheral lipoatrophy, truncal lipohypertrophy, and combined versions of these presentations. A more severe presentation occurs at puberty. Thyroid abnormalities with hypothyroidism have also occurred in children infected perinatally. [ 26]  A variety of skin conditions, including exaggerated eczema, psoriasis, drug eruptions (including morbilliform eruptions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), intense reactions to arthropod bites, [ 27]  alopecia, and trichomegaly, have been reported in children who are HIV positive. Children with HIV infection are at risk for child abuse because of family stressors; therefore, unusual skin lesions should be evaluated for potential signs of exogenous injury. A higher incidence of neoplasia is noted in children with HIV infection than in noninfected children. [ 28]  B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and smooth muscle tumors, have been identified. The prevalence of HIV-associated malignancies has been reported to be as high as 2%. A 2005 evaluation of 2969 pediatric patients with AIDS in the United States from 1993-2003 revealed that the incidence of malignancy is 1.56 cases per 1000 person-years, a number lower than in European counterparts but significantly higher than in noninfected children. [ 29]  Kaposi sarcoma is unusual in children; however, an African study has shown the childhood incidence of Kaposi sarcoma has risen more than 40-fold since the advent of the AIDS epidemic. [ 30]  Previously thought to only occur in males, it has been reported in both males and females born to mothers who are infected with HIV in high-risk groups for Kaposi sarcoma or in children infected postnatally by blood products. The most common sites of AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma in children are the orofacial and the inguinal or genital regions. [ 31]  Few physical findings are specific to HIV infection, and many physical findings are caused by opportunistic infections. Lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly are fairly common in HIV infection. Other findings may include those discussed below. Anthropometric findings Monitoring the patient's growth is one of the most important parts of the pediatric physical examination. Anthropometric measurements should be obtained at each visit. Delayed growth in the head circumference is correlated with the development of underlying encephalopathy. However, normal head growth does not help in ruling out encephalopathy, and many patients with a normal head circumference may have radiographic or psychometric findings consistent with encephalopathy. Fat redistribution syndrome in association with lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance is being described in HIV-infected children and adults. Presentations vary (eg, central adiposity vs peripheral fat wasting) and depend on factors such as race and age. Body habitus is altered because of lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy, or both. Diverse diagnostic criteria have been used. Anthropometric measurements, such as skin-fold thickness and the waist-to-hip ratio, are useful to monitor the progression of changes. Technically sophisticated tools include bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), CT, and MRI. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) findings Parotid enlargement is observed in 30% of children with category C disease (see Staging) and in 15% of children with disease in other categories. Tonsillar hypertrophy may be observed. Aphthous ulcers may be observed. Thrush in the oral cavity and posterior pharynx is observed in approximately 30% of HIV-infected children. In children with AIDS, the prevalence of thrush is correlated with a low CD4 +  count. Thrush in the posterior pharynx may signify candidal esophagitis, especially in patients with feeding difficulties or retrosternal pain. CMV retinitis occurs in 3.4% of children with CD4 +  counts of less than 50/mL. Cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal findings Cardiomyopathy may be present. Congestive heart failure may be present. Lung examination is important, and good documentation of findings is required at each visit. Chronic lung disease may produce baseline findings of crackles and decreased regional breath sounds. Changes in the lung findings are important to note because pneumonia is common in children with HIV infection. Pneumonia may not be obvious during the examination, and many children have few symptoms. For example,  Mycoplasma  infection may not cause a high temperature, and  Pneumocystis jiroveci  infection may cause only tachypnea, fever, and hypoxemia. Changing findings at lung examination may also signify worsening of chronic lung disease, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, or  tuberculosis . Hepatomegaly is observed in 45% of HIV-infected children without AIDS and in 70% of those with AIDS. Splenomegaly is observed in about 35% of children with HIV infection. Lymphatic findings Generalized cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy is common and may be the first sign of initial infection during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. Generalized lymphadenopathy may not be present with well-controlled disease or end-stage AIDS. New shotty nodes may indicate that the disease has again progressed and that treatment failure has occurred. A single large node may indicate lymphoma, and it may need to be examined with biopsy. Neurologic findings Motor delay, hypotonia, hypertonia, and/or pyramidal-tract signs may indicate progressive HIV encephalopathy or opportunistic infection of the CNS. Spastic diplegia and oral motor dysfunction are early signs of encephalopathy. Acquired microcephaly with accompanying cerebral atrophy is a poor prognostic sign. Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with higher cortical dysfunction occurs in vitamin B-12 deficiency. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes can occur in children with AIDS, but they seem to be related to infection or other mechanisms other than atherosclerosis or hypercoagulable states, as in the adult HIV-infected population. Skin findings HIV dermatitis causes an erythematous papular rash and is observed in about 25% of children with HIV infection. Vesicular lesions in a unilateral dermatomal distribution or in the oral, genital, or anal area may represent reactivation of herpes zoster. Erythematous candidal dermatitis that does not respond to standard therapy may be present. Bleeding or bruising of the mucous membranes and skin may be observed in children with HIV and immune thrombocytopenic purpura, although this is uncommon. Extremity findings Digital clubbing may be observed as a result of chronic lung disease. Nonpitting edema may result from hypoalbuminemia caused by HIV nephropathy or malnutrition. Pitting edema may develop as a result of congestive heart failure. Opportunistic infections PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in children with vertically transmitted HIV infection unless antibiotic prophylaxis is used. Without prophylaxis, PCP commonly occurs in infants aged 3 months. Without prophylactic suppression, infection may develop in infants younger than 1 year regardless of their baseline CD4 +  count because the rapid progression of immunosuppression may precipitate a sharp decrease in their CD4 +  counts. PCP typically occurs in children with moderate immune suppression; this warrants category C classification. Upon examination, fever and tachypnea are usually the presenting symptoms. Chest radiographs may or may not show diffuse interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. Lung examination may or may not reveal rales. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting PCP antigen in a sputum or, preferably, in a specimen obtained during bronchoscopic lavage. Systemic complications Dysrhythmias, hemodynamic abnormalities, and cardiomyopathy develop in about 20% and 5% of HIV-infected children with AIDS and those without AIDS, respectively. Congestive heart failure is a late manifestation of HIV infection. Children must be treated symptomatically with sodium restriction, diuretics, digitalis glycosides, and angiotensin converting–enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy. Progressive changes in cardiac structure are correlated with disease progression. Chronic diarrhea develops in approximately 15% of children with HIV infection. Infectious agents may cause diarrhea. MAC and  Cryptosporidium  species are not uncommon causes of diarrhea in children with low CD4 +  counts. Stool examination and cultures for bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites, and acid-fast organisms should be performed every day for at least 3 days, with special instructions for detecting  Cryptosporidium, Isospora,  and microsporidia organisms.  Clostridium difficile  tests should be requested if patients currently or recently received antimicrobial therapy. Bile-acid malabsorption, but not bacterial overgrowth, appears to contribute to chronic diarrhea of HIV. Cholestyramine 4-8 g given 3 times a day may substantially slow diarrhea in some patients. Pancreatitis can develop from medication, ascending infection, or the HIV infection itself. Amylase and lipase levels should be monitored in patients at risk for pancreatitis with abdominal complaints. Abdominal pain with associated diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal lymphadenopathy, fever, or anemia is common in disseminated MAC infection. In adults, wasting syndrome is common with advanced disease. Although older children with advanced disease may have wasting syndrome, young children have growth failure even without advanced disease. Undiagnosed HIV infection may present in patients with a diagnosis of failure to thrive. Nephropathy In approximately 15% and 5% of HIV-infected children with AIDS and those without AIDS, respectively, the disease progresses to HIV nephropathy. HIV nephropathy is more common in African American children than in others. Proteinuria and hyponatremia with elevation in BUN and creatinine levels and a slight increase in blood pressure develop early and are not uncommon. Renal biopsy most often reveals focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or, sometimes, mesangial hyperplasia. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis and minimal histologic changes also are observed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to have kidney-sparing effects and are being studied. Symptomatic treatment with fluid restriction, a low-salt diet, and diuretics may be needed in cases of frank nephrosis. Non-HIV nephropathy may develop, especially in children who are treated with repeat courses of nephrotoxic medications. Some children have chronic renal failure with electrolyte wasting. Electrolyte levels should be monitored closely, and patients should receive appropriate supplementation. Workup Approach Considerations Prompt diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is critical. As such, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine prenatal HIV testing as the standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States, with repeat screening in the third trimester recommended in certain jurisdictions with elevated rates of HIV infection among pregnant women. [ 32]  However, routine late pregnancy testing at 36-37 weeks' gestation in all women is recommended by many experts because infection during pregnancy now makes up a significant percentage of children with AIDS. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists updated their guidelines on HIV testing during pregnancy. [ 33,  34]  The new guidelines include the following: Women should be tested for HIV during routine prenatal testing, on an opt-out basis where possible. Women at high risk for HIV, including injection drug users and women with multiple sex partners during their pregnancy, should be tested again in their third trimester. Women who have not been tested should be offered rapid screening when in labor, and if the rapid test is positive, they should start antiretroviral therapy while waiting for results from a confirmatory test. All pregnant women should be screened for HIV infection as early as possible during each pregnancy using the opt-out approach where allowed. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for women in areas with high HIV incidence or prevalence and for women known to be at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise undocumented should be offered rapid screening on labor and delivery using the opt-out approach where allowed. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while waiting for supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement. Diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is aided by HIV culture or DNA/RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR); positive results are confirmed by repeating the test. In suspected cases, HIV testing should occur in the newborn period (ie, before the infant is 48 h old), at age 1-2 months, and again at age 3-6 months. Testing at age 14 days may allow for earlier detection of HIV in infants who had negative test results within the first 48 hours of life. By approximately age 1 month, PCR testing has a 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity to identify HIV. The 2010 Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children [ 3]  recommendations for diagnosing infants are as follows: Because of the persistence of the maternal HIV antibody, infants younger than 18 months require virologic assays that directly detect HIV in order to diagnose HIV infection Preferred virologic assays include HIV bDNA PCR and HIV RNA assays Further virologic testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at 14 days, at 1 month, and at 4 months. An antibody test to document seroreversion to HIV antibody–negative status in uninfected infants is no longer recommended at age 12–18 months In children 18 months and older, HIV antibody assays can be used for diagnosis The Panel does not recommend use of the currently approved HIV p24 antigen assay for infant diagnosis in the United States because the sensitivity and specificity of the assay in the first months of life is less than that of other HIV virologic tests. Within the first 48 hours, 14 days, and 4 weeks of life, 38%, 93%, and 96% of infected children, respectively, have positive HIV DNA PCR results. Any positive HIV DNA PCR finding should be confirmed with follow-up HIV DNA PCR before infection is diagnosed. HIV infection can be ruled out if one of the following is true: DNA HIV PCR results are consistently negative in an infant older than 4 months in the absence of breastfeeding. Two DNA HIV PCR results obtained at least a month apart are negative in an infant older than 6 months. Monitor CD4 +  levels or percentages in infants or patients newly diagnosed with HIV at 3- to 4-month intervals to assess patients' immune status. In children younger than 5 years, the 2010 Panel recommends using CD4 percentages over absolute CD4 counts for monitoring disease progression because of inherent age-related changes in absolute CD4 counts. Monitor for opportunistic infections. Perform a CBC count with differential and a urinalysis every 1-3 months in infants. Older children can be screened every 3-6 months (CBC count) or yearly (urinalysis). Culture urine samples monthly for the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) until age 2 months and then at 2-month intervals until age 12 months. Assess HIV RNA levels twice at baseline and then every 3-4 months. (Consistently use the same HIV RNA assay method to monitor a particular patient.) More frequent testing of HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts may be necessary for children who have virologic or clinical deterioration or when initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy or in children under 12 months of age. If the mother is HIV positive, use serologic tests to screen the infant for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis. Decreased levels of albumin, serum immunoglobulin G, and CD8 +  T cells are linked with fatality in children. Monitor laboratory studies in accordance with drug therapy protocols and clinical status (eg, lipid profile in a patient with lipodystrophy). Perform chest radiography, CT scanning, MRI, echocardiography, and electrocardiography for baseline determinations and subsequently as clinically indicated. For example, brain imaging is indicated in patients with suspected HIV encephalopathy. Imaging may demonstrate degeneration of the white matter, atrophy, and/or calcifications of the basal ganglia with progressive HIV encephalopathy. Detection of HIV HIV detection is the first step in the laboratory workup. In September 2006, the CDC released its  Revised Recommendations for HIV Testing of Adults Adolescents, and Pregnant Women in Health-Care Settings . [ 32]  These new recommendations, which replaced the CDC’s 1993 Recommendations for HIV Testing Services for Inpatients and Outpatients in Acute Care Hospital Settings, advise routine HIV screening for adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in healthcare settings in the United States. They also recommend reducing barriers to HIV testing. A 2011 revision to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement recommends that routine screening be offered to all adolescents at least once by 16 to 18 years of age in communities with high HIV prevalence. In areas of lower prevalence, routine testing is encouraged for all sexually active adolescents and those with other risk factors for HIV. [ 35]  Detection of antibody to HIV is the usual first step in diagnosing HIV infection. In adults and older children, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting are used to initially detect HIV-specific antibodies. However, because maternal antibodies are present in neonatal blood, these tests are not used for diagnosis in patients younger than 2 years. A nucleic acid PCR assay is the standard detection method in infants and young children. HIV DNA PCR is used to detect HIV-1 provirus in mononuclear cells by using oligonucleotides directed at highly conserved regions of the viral genome. This test can be performed within 24 hours of infection and has a sensitivity and a specificity of 95% and 97%, respectively. Although it is more sensitive than viral culturing, the diagnostic performances of the 2 methods are equivalent. Viral cultures are obtained by co-cultivating potentially infected and uninfected mononuclear cells together to promote viral replication. Every few days, the culture is assayed for HIV p24 antigen. Positive results on 2 sequential p24 antigen detection assays indicate infection. This technique requires a mean of 7-14 days to perform, but it may require as long as 28 days. A positive virologic result should be confirmed with repeat virologic testing with a second specimen as soon as possible after the first result is available. ELISA for HIV antibody, followed by a confirmatory Western blot (which has increased specificity), should be used to diagnose HIV infection in older children and adults. Rapid HIV tests, which provide results in minutes, simplify and expand the availability of HIV testing. Their sensitivity is as high as 100%, but they must be followed with confirmatory Western blotting or immunofluorescence antibody testing, as with conventional HIV antibody tests. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 4 rapid HIV screening tests that are available commercially in the United States, as listed below. Before the FDA approved these tests, the most commonly used rapid HIV test was the Single-Use Diagnostic System (Murex SUDS; Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL), which is no longer available. OraQuick (and its newer version OraQuick Advance) Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test (OraSure Technologies, Inc, Bethlehem, PA) Reveal G3 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test (MedMira Laboratories, Inc, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada) Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV Test (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA) HIV RNA assays are used to detect extracellular viral RNA in the plasma and are as sensitive as HIV DNA PCR for early diagnosis of HIV infection in exposed infants. However, nucleic acid amplification tests are not the preferred methods of diagnosis in infants perinatally exposed because they may falsely indicate low viral loads in individuals who are HIV negative. Also, whether antenatal treatment of the mother with combination antiretrovirals and/or antiretroviral prophylaxis in the infant affects the sensitivity of RNA assays is unknown. The FDA has approved the APTIMA HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay (Gen-Probe Incorporated, San Diego, CA). This assay enables people to learn with certainty whether they are infected within a few days rather than up to 6 months, as with an HIV antibody test. Unlike some approved antibody tests, the APTIMA assay is intended to detect only HIV-1 and not HIV-2. The test could become a potential alternative to traditional Western blotting now used to confirm HIV-1 infection when screening results for HIV antibodies are positive. The APTIMA assay is approved for the diagnosis of primary HIV-1 infection for confirming HIV-1 infection when antibody results are positive. Viral Load Testing The viral load can be quantified by using several HIV assays. The number of virions in the peripheral blood is an important indicator of disease activity and of the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART). A 5- or 3-fold change in the viral load is needed to reliably indicate a clinically significant change in children younger than 2 years or older than 2 years, respectively. Certain viral-load tests are not sensitive to non-B subtypes of HIV-1. Therefore, viral loads can seem to be considerably reduced if these tests are used to process samples of non-B subtypes. Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and nucleic acid sequence—based amplification (NASBA) of plasma RNA reveal a viral load 2 times that obtained with the branched-chain DNA (bDNA) method. The former methods are sensitive to only HIV-1 subtype B viruses, whereas the bDNA method is sensitive to other HIV-1 subtypes. Switching test methods during treatment is not advised because their molecular technologies differ. Initial infection is associated with high viral loads, especially in the neonate. In adults and adolescents with nonvertically acquired infections, the viral load rapidly decreases 6-12 months after the primary viremia. Neonates have high viral loads that persist throughout infancy; therefore, these values are hard to interpret in the first year of life. In children with vertically acquired infections, the load slowly declines after 1 year of age. The predictive value of specific HIV RNA concentrations for disease progression and death for an individual child in the first year of life is moderate. Viral Resistance Assays Viral resistance to ART may be present. Both primary and secondary mutations can develop. Primary mutations alter the effectiveness of ART. Secondary mutations improve viral survival. Both genotypic and phenotypic assays can be performed. Genotypic assays are fast and available, but they reveal only known mutations, and they cannot be used to predict complex interactions when several antiretroviral drugs (ARDs) are used together. Automated recombinant phenotypic assays are commercially available, but the results require additional time to be ready, and the tests are expensive. However, these assays can be used to detect complex interactions between ARDs and quasispecies, to perform in vitro drug trials, and to measure ART inhibitory concentrations. Resistance testing is recommended before the initiation of ART in all treatment-naïve children, with the results used to refine selection of drugs for initial combination therapy. Resistance testing is also recommended before changing therapy for treatment failure. [ 3]  Genotype and phenotype assays may not be useful for detecting minor quasispecies, and treatment failure occurs despite the use of these techniques. Development of resistance to 1 or more of the drugs in a combination regimen is often the cause for viral rebound. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical use of ARD-resistance testing in selecting an alternate effective combination and in improving clinical outcomes. Hematology Studies The CD4 +  lymphocyte count is a surrogate marker for disease progression and should be monitored closely. The CD4 +  count should be obtained before therapy. A rapid decrease in the count, especially in infants younger than 1 year, is a poor prognostic sign and should prompt the start or alteration of therapy. Consumptive thrombocytopenia is a common finding in children with HIV infection and may be observed in 10% of patients at initial diagnosis. Anemia occurs in as many as 20% of patients at diagnosis and occurs in as many as 80% of patients at some time. Anemia can have many etiologies in HIV infected individuals and requires a workup as described in Medical Care. A high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is most commonly caused by zidovudine and can be used to verify compliance. Other medications also cause a high MCV, as well as vitamin B-12 and folate deficiencies. Anemia continues to predict decreased survival even with highly active ART (HAART). Pancytopenia results from folate deficiency, use of pharmaceutical agents, and infections with viruses such as parvovirus B19. Neutropenia is observed in 10% of patients with early asymptomatic HIV infections and in 50% of patients with AIDS. Blood smears may reveal large ovalocytes and hypersegmented polymorphonucleocytes in cases of folate deficiency. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests Serum electrolytes should be monitored on a regular basis because medications or HIV infection may induce nephrotoxicity. Liver function can be impaired as a result of medication, HIV, co-infection with hepatitis viruses, or opportunistic infections, so transaminase levels should be monitored. Pancreatitis can be the result of medication, HIV or opportunistic infections, so amylase and lipase levels should be monitored in patients with abdominal symptoms. Parotiditis (parotitis) is not uncommon, and amylase levels should be followed up if parotiditis is suspected or if the patient has a history of the condition. Quantitative immunoglobulin levels should be followed up periodically. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia is associated with disease progression. Hypoimmunoglobulinemia is observed in end-stage disease and is associated with a poor prognosis. Renal Imaging Studies Patients with HIV nephropathy demonstrate increased size and echogenicity of the kidneys on renal ultrasonography, with a loss of cortical medullary differentiation. Renal cysts are observed with an increased incidence. On renal CT scanning, stasis of urine in the pyramids is observed in patients with HIV nephropathy. This finding, combined with characteristic renal ultrasound findings, is specific for HIV nephropathy. Renal scintigraphy with technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine ( 99m  Tc MAG3) demonstrates delayed elimination of the tracer and increased residual activity consistent with tubular dysfunction in HIV nephropathy. These abnormalities correlated with creatinine clearance. On renal gallium scanning, increased signal indicates inflammation in patients with HIV nephropathy and is correlated with proteinuria. Biopsy A biopsy sample should be taken from enlarged lymph nodes of undetermined cause, especially if they are single, hard, nonmotile, or unaccompanied by generalized lymphadenopathy. Biopsy may also be considered to clearly determine the identity of an apparently infectious or malignant cutaneous lesion. Maintain a high index of suspicion for a wide array of infections and malignancies, and request the appropriate staining and tissue preparation. Diagnosis of Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonitis Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) is the second most common AIDS-defining illness in children. LIP most commonly occurs in children with a relatively high CD4 +  count. Chest radiography demonstrates a reticulonodular pattern with or without hilar adenopathy that persists for more than 2 months despite treatment. Patients are usually asymptomatic at first, but cough and shortness of breath develop as lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis progresses. Hypoxia typically responds to a 2-week course of steroids, but oxygen dependence develops if an underlying chronic lung disease exists. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis increases the risk of bacterial pneumonia, especially with  Haemophilus influenzae  and pneumococcus. Recurrent pneumonia destroys lung tissue and leads to chronic lung disease. Chest radiographs demonstrate chronic changes, including areas of chronic atelectasis. This condition requires management by a pulmonologist. Chronic respiratory therapy may be required, including home oxygen therapy. Staging Clinical categories are based on the 2010 CDC guidelines [ 3]  for antiretroviral treatment of pediatric AIDS (review and modification of the 1994 CDC HIV pediatric classification system for clinical categories in children younger than 13 y). This system uses a clinical-category letter and an immunologic number to note each stage of disease progression. The clinical categories are based on clinic manifestations. The immunologic category is based on the age-dependent CD4 +  count (see Table 1, below). Clinical categories include the following: N – Not symptomatic A – Mildly symptomatic B – Moderately symptomatic C – Severely symptomatic. Category N includes children who have no signs or symptoms considered to be the result of HIV infection or who have only one of the conditions listed in category A. Category A includes children with 2 or more of the following conditions but none of the conditions listed in categories B and C: Lymphadenopathy (≥0.5 cm at more than 2 sites; bilateral = one site) Hepatomegaly Splenomegaly Dermatitis Parotitis Recurrent or persistent upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, or otitis media Category B includes children who have symptomatic conditions, other than those listed for category A or category C, that are attributed to HIV infection. Examples of conditions in clinical category B include, but are not limited to, the following: Anemia (< 8 g/dL), neutropenia (< 1,000 cells/µL), or thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 cells/µL) persisting 30 days or longer Bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis (single episode) Candidiasis, oropharyngeal (ie, thrush) persisting for greater than 2 months in children older than 6 months Cardiomyopathy Cytomegalovirus infection with onset before age 1 month Diarrhea, recurrent or chronic Hepatitis Herpes simplex virus (HSV) stomatitis, recurrent (ie, >2 episodes within 1 y) HSV bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis with onset before age 1 month Herpes zoster (ie, shingles) involving at least 2 distinct episodes or more than one dermatome Leiomyosarcoma Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia complex Nephropathy Nocardiosis Fever lasting greater than 1 month Toxoplasmosis with onset before age 1 month Varicella, disseminated (ie, complicated chickenpox) Category C includes children who have any condition listed in the 1987 surveillance case definition for AIDS, with the exception of LIP (which is a category B condition). These conditions are as follows: Serious bacterial infections, multiple or recurrent (ie, any combination of at least 2 culture-confirmed infections within a 2-y period), of the following types: septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis, bone or joint infection, or abscess of an internal organ or body cavity (excluding otitis media, superficial skin or mucosal abscesses, and indwelling catheter-related infections) Candidiasis, esophageal or pulmonary (bronchi, trachea, lungs) Coccidioidomycosis, disseminated (at site other than or in addition to lungs or cervical or hilar lymph nodes) Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary Cryptosporidiosis or isosporiasis with diarrhea persisting greater than 1 month Cytomegalovirus disease with onset of symptoms at older than 1 month (at a site other than liver, spleen, or lymph nodes) Encephalopathy (at least one of the following progressive findings present for at least 2 mo in the absence of a concurrent illness other than HIV infection that could explain the findings): Failure to attain or loss of developmental milestones or loss of intellectual ability, verified by standard developmental scale or neuropsychological tests; impaired brain growth or acquired microcephaly demonstrated by head circumference measurements or brain atrophy demonstrated by CT scanning or MRI (serial imaging required for children < 2 y); acquired symmetric motor deficit manifested by 2 or more of the following: paresis, pathologic reflexes, ataxia, or gait disturbance Herpes simplex virus infection causing a mucocutaneous ulcer that persists for greater than 1 month; or bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis for any duration affecting a child older than 1 month Histoplasmosis, disseminated (at a site other than or in addition to lungs or cervical or hilar lymph nodes) Kaposi sarcoma Lymphoma, primary, in brain Lymphoma, small, noncleaved cell (Burkitt), or immunoblastic or large cell lymphoma of B-cell or unknown immunologic phenotype Mycobacterium tuberculosis , disseminated or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium , other species or unidentified species, disseminated (at a site other than or in addition to lungs, skin, or cervical or hilar lymph nodes) M avium  complex or  M  kansasii, disseminated (at site other than or in addition to lungs, skin, or cervical or hilar lymph nodes) Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Salmonella  (nontyphoid) septicemia, recurrent Toxoplasmosis of the brain with onset at older than 1 month Wasting syndrome in the absence of a concurrent illness other than HIV infection that could explain the following findings: Persistent weight loss of >10% of baseline OR Downward crossing of at least 2 of the following percentile lines on the weight-for-age chart (eg, 95th, 75th, 50th, 25th, 5th) in a child aged 1 year or older OR Less than the 5th percentile on weight-for-height chart on 2 consecutive measurements, 30 days or greater apart PLUS 1) chronic diarrhea (ie, ≥2 loose stools/d for >30 d) OR 2) documented fever (for ≥30 d, intermittent or constant) Once an advanced class is assigned, the disease cannot be reassigned to a lesser class, even if the clinical or immunologic manifestations resolve. Category C and clinical manifestations of advanced disease are synonymous with AIDS. Table 1. CDC Immunologic Categories for HIV-Infection in Children Based on Absolute CD4 +  Counts Category   < 1 y 1-5 y 6-12 y 1 - No suppression ≥1500 (>25) ≥1000 (>25) ≥500 (>25) 2 - Moderate suppression 750-1499 (15-24) 500-999 (15-24) 200-499 (15-24) 3 - Severe suppression < 750 (< 15) < 500 (< 15) < 200 (< 15) Treatment & Management Approach Considerations ART is the mainstay in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. Appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment of specific infections and malignancies are critical in treating patients who are HIV positive. Intervening early may prevent damage to the immune system and potentially retard dissemination of infection. Combination ART is recommended for all infants, children, and adolescents who meet treatment criteria. Reduction in the mortality rate associated with perinatally acquired HIV-1 over the past 10 years is a result of improved ART. However, only triple combination ART appears to significantly reduce the relative hazard ratio of death, as compared with no treatment. The inadequacy of merely reducing the viral load has been realized in recent years. Quick suppression of the viral load with highly active ART (HAART) substantially slows viral replication and prevents resistant mutations. Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children The following are the 2015 goals for treating pediatric patients with HIV infection, from the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children [ 3]  : Reducing HIV-related mortality and morbidity Restoring and/or preserving immune function Maximally and durably suppressing viral replication Minimizing drug-related toxicity Maintaining normal physical growth and neurocognitive development Improving quality of life The following are several important factors to consider in making treatment decisions about when to initiate antiretroviral therapy: Severity of HIV disease Risk of disease progression Laboratory assessments (eg, CD4 +  count, plasma HIV RNA levels) Availability of appropriate and palatable drug formulations Adverse effects of the antiretroviral medications Effect of initial treatment regimen choice on later therapeutic options Presence of comorbidities that may affect drug choices Potential antiretroviral drug interactions with required concomitant medications Ability of the child and caregiver to adhere to treatment regimen Opportunistic infections A high prevalence of infections, such as candidiasis and varicella-zoster virus infection, must also be anticipated, and appropriate prevention and treatment strategies must be initiated. An expert panel issued updated guidelines in December 2013 for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and infected children. The panel represents the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. [ 36]  Key updates in the guidelines cover the following topics [ 36]  : HPV vaccine Meningococcal vaccine Influenza vaccine, chemoprophylaxis, and management Pneumococcal vaccine Hepatitis B vaccine Other considerations As the disease progresses, wasting is noted, with weight loss and growth retardation in children. Low protein stores can be countered by increasing the intake of amino acids, specifically threonine and methionine. Address abnormalities in psychological and neurologic development, due, in part, to the tropism of the virus for CNS tissue in children who are HIV positive. Social, economic, and psychological factors impair the ability of many HIV-infected children and their parents to attend regular clinic appointments. This problem can be challenging and may require substantial use of social and child protective services on a regular basis. Psychosocial support is extremely important. Failure to provide such services can result in a lack of compliance with medications and appointments. Treatment guidelines for HIV disease change constantly. The most current guidelines may be viewed at the  AIDS Info  Web site, a service of the US Department of Health and Human Services. Although current HAART regimens have substantially and dramatically decreased AIDS-related opportunistic infections (OIs) and deaths, prevention and management of OIs remain critical components of care for HIV-infected children. [ 37]  In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics released  Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Among HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children . Overview of Antiretroviral Therapy Nearly 30 antiretroviral drugs have been approved for use in adults and adolescents with HIV; 19 of these have an approved pediatric treatment indication, and more than 15 are available as a pediatric formulation or capsule size. Classes of antiretroviral agents include the following: Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Fusion inhibitors CCR5 co-receptor antagonists (entry inhibitors) HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors The reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, NNRTIs) suppress HIV replication by competitive inhibition of viral reverse transcriptase. PIs prevent the late stages of viral replication by interfering with the formation of structural proteins of the virion core. Treatment Guidelines Recommended treatment regimens are constantly modified and changed; any publication like this article may become quickly outdated. Therefore, this article is intended to be a primer, and all children should be referred to a pediatric infectious specialist for management. Most patients with vertically acquired HIV are treated regardless of their immune status. Most infants younger than 1 year should be aggressively treated. Pediatric HIV experts agree that infected infants who have clinical symptoms of HIV disease or evidence of immune compromise should be treated. [ 3]  Patients aged 1 year or older with AIDS or significant symptoms should be aggressively treated regardless of CD4 percentage and count or plasma HIV RNA level. The importance of early treatment of HIV in children younger than 12 months was illustrated in the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy trial, which showed a 76% reduction in infant mortality and a 75% reduction in HIV progression with the early initiation of treatment. [ 38]  A study by Cotton et al found that fosamprenavir/ritonavir–containing regimens in HIV-infected children aged 4 weeks to 2 years achieved plasma amprenavir exposures comparable to those of regimens approved in adults (except for trough exposures in infants under age 6 months). Viral suppression was achieved in 61% of patients, and the regimens were generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, and otitis media. [ 39]  For patients aged 1 year or older, the age-related CD4 thresholds for initiating treatment are less than 25% for children aged 1-4 years and less than 350 cells/μL for children aged 5 years or older, regardless of symptoms or plasma HIV RNA level. Initiate treatment in children aged 1 year or older who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and have a CD4 of 25% or more in children aged 1-4 years or 350 cells/μL or more in children aged 5 years or older who have plasma HIV RNA of 100,000 copies/mL or more. ART may be considered or deferred in children aged 1 year or older who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and who have a CD4 of 25% or more in children aged 1-4 years and 350 cell/μL or more for children aged 5 years or older who have plasma HIV RNA or less than 100,000 copies/mL. When treating older children, some advocate considering a child's Tanner stage when determining dosing regimens. Adolescents in early puberty (Tanner stages I and II) should be treated according to pediatric dosing guidelines. Adolescents in late puberty (Tanner stage IV) and postpubertal adolescents should follow adult dosing guidelines. Initial combination therapy for ART-naive children Combination ART with at least 3 drugs from at least 2 classes of drugs is recommended for initial treatment of infected infants, children, and adolescents because it provides the best opportunity to preserve immune function and delay disease progression. The use of zidovudine as a single agent is appropriate only when used in infants of indeterminate HIV status during the first 6 weeks of life to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. Infants confirmed as HIV infected while receiving chemoprophylaxis should have prophylactic antiretroviral drugs discontinued and treatment initiated, with a combination regimen of at least 3 drugs. The only preferred regimens for children younger than 3 years are coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy and nevirapine-based therapy. Infants exposed to nevirapine in the peripartum period as part of a preventing-mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) strategy should not be treated with nevirapine-based combination therapy because of the established higher risk of treatment failure due to nevirapine resistance. Lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination therapy would be the only recommended, preferred initial regimen. One study evaluated the use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy in children younger than 6 years with HIV type 1 infection who have not undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Seventy percent of the 43 children in the study realized a virologic success at month 12. Overall, 20 children experienced virologic failure; risk factors for virologic failure were determined to be young age and low socioeconomic status. [ 40]  In August 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the integrase strand transfer inhibitor dolutegravir as an adjunct agent for patients with HIV-1 infection. Dolutegravir, which interferes with an enzyme needed for HIV to multiply, is a once-daily pill used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Pediatric indications are for children aged 12 years or older who weigh at least 40 kg and are treatment-naïve or, if they are treatment-experienced, have not previously taken other integrase strand transfer inhibitors. [ 41,  42]  In December 2013, the FDA approved an oral suspension formulation of the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir for use, with or without food, in pediatric patients aged 4 weeks and older who weigh at least 3 kg and less than 20 kg. [ 43,  44,  45]  This agent is used in combination with other HIV-1 antiretroviral agents. The combination product Genvoya (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF) was approved in 2015 as a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 infection in adults and children aged ≥12 y (weight ≥35 kg) who are ART-naïve or to replace the current ART regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ART regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components. [ 46]  In February 2016, emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF (Complera) was approved as complete regimen for treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older (weight ≥35 kg) with HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL, and in certain virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) patients on a stable ART regimen at start of therapy in order to replace their current ART regimen. [ 47]  Drug combinations for initial therapy include a backbone of 2 NRTIs  plus  1 NNRTI,  or  2 NRTIs  plus  a PI (generally with low-dose ritonavir boosting). [ 3]  Preferred regimens are as follows: Aged ≥14 days to <3 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  lopinavir/ritonavir Aged ≥3 years to <6 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  efavirenz  or  2 NRTIs  plus  lopinavir/ritonavir Aged ≥6 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  atazanavir (plus low-dose ritonavir)  or  efavirenz  or  lopinavir/ritonavir Alternative regimens are as follows: Aged >14 days: 2 NRTIs  plus  nevirapine Aged ≥3 months to <6 years (weighing ≥10 kg): 2 NRTIs  plus  atazanavir (plus low-dose ritonavir) Aged ≥2 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  raltegravir Aged ≥3 years to <12 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  twice-daily DRV (plus low-dose ritonavir) Aged ≥12 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  once-daily DRV (plus low-dose ritonavir) Aged ≥12 years (weighing ≥40 kg): 2 NRTIs  plus  dolutegravir Regimens for use in special circumstances are as follows:  Aged ≥4 weeks and <2 years who weigh ≥3 kg: 2 NRTIs  plus  raltegravir Aged ≥6 months: 2 NRTIs  plus  fosamprenavir Aged ≥2 years: 2 NRTIs  plus  nelfinavir Aged ≥13 years (weighing >39 kg): 2 NRTIs  plus  atazanavir (unboosted) Preferred 2-NRTI backbone options for use in combination with additional drugs are as follows: Birth to 3 months: zidovudine  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) Aged ≥3 months to ≤12 years: abacavir  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine)  or  zidovudine  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) Aged ≥13 years at Tanner Stage 3: abacavir  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) Adolescents at Tanner Stage 4/5: abacavir  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine)  or  tenofovir DF  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) Alternative 2-NRTI backbone options for use in combination with additional drugs are as follows: Aged ≥2 weeks: didanosine  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine)  or  zidovudine  plus  didanosine Aged ≥3 months: zidovudine plus abacavir Children and adolescents at Tanner Stage 3: tenofovir DF  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) Adolescents ≥13 years: zidovudine  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) 2-NRTI regimens for use in special circumstances in combination with additional drugs are as follows: Stavudine  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) Prepubertal children aged >2 years and adolescents, Tanner Stage 1 or 2: tenofovir DF  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) ART regimens or components not recommended for initial HIV treatment in children are as follows: Unboosted atazanavir-containing regimens in children aged <13 years and/or weight <39 kg Darunavir-based regimens once daily in children aged ≥3 years to 12 years Unboosted darunavir Dual (full-dose) PI regimens Dual NRTI combination of abacavir plus didanosine Dual NRTI combination of abacavir plus tenofovir DF Dual NRTI combination of stavudine plus didanosine Dual NRTI combination of tenofovir DF plus didanosine Efavirenz-based regimens for aged <3 years Dolutegravir-based regimens for aged <12 years or weight <40 kg Enfuvirtide-containing regimens Etravirine-based regimens Elvitegravir-based regimens Fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting Indinavir-based regimensLopinavir/ritonavir dosed once daily Maraviroc-based regimens Nelfinavir-containing regimens for aged <2 years Regimens containing only NRTIs Regimens containing 3 drug classes Full-dose ritonavir or use of ritonavir as the sole PI Regimens containing 3 NRTIs and an NNRTI Rilpivirine-based regimens Saquinavir-based regimens Tenofovir-containing regimens in children aged <2 years Tipranavir-based regimens ART  regimens  that should  never be recommended  for HIV treatment in children are as follows: One ARV drug alone (monotherapy) 2 NRTIs alone Tenofovir  plus  abacavir  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) as a triple-NRTI regimen Tenofovir  plus  didanosine  plus  (lamivudine or emtricitabine) as a triple-NRTI regimen ART  components  that should  never be recommended  for HIV treatment in children are as follows: Atazanavir  plus  indinavir Dual-NNRTI combinations Dual-NRTI combinations of lamivudine  plus  emtricitabine  or  stavudine  plus  zidovudine Efavirenz in first trimester of pregnancy or for sexually active adolescent girls when reliable contraception cannot be ensured Nevirapine as initial therapy in adolescent girls with CD4 count >250 cells/mm 3  or adolescent boys with CD4 count >400 cells/mm 3 Unboosted saquinavir, darunavir, or tipranavir Monitoring therapy Close monitoring to determine whether the child is tolerating ART and to answer any questions the caregiver may have are essential to the success of these therapies. At 4-8 weeks after the start of therapy, the CD4 +  count and/or percentage and HIV RNA levels should be reassessed, and laboratory evaluations for toxicity should be done. The main goal of therapy is to lower HIV RNA to undetectable levels, although not all infants achieve this. Some have a 10-fold or 5-fold decrease in the viral load. Treatment failure Treatment failure is defined as virologic, immunologic, or clinical. [ 3]  Virologic failure includes incomplete response and viral rebound. Incomplete virologic response to therapy is defined for all children with any of the following: A less than 1.0 10  decrease in HIV RNA copy number from baseline after 8–12 weeks of therapy, HIV RNA of greater than 400 copies/µL after 6 months of therapy Repeated HIV RNA levels above the level of detection after 12 months of therapy (However, children with very high viral load levels may take longer to go to undetectable levels.) Viral rebound is repeated detection of HIV RNA despite previously achieved undetectable viral load levels Immunologic failure includes incomplete response and immunologic decline. Incomplete response is defined as a failure by a child younger than 5 years with severe immune suppression (CD4 +  < 15%) to improve CD4 +  values by 5 or more percentage points, or as a failure by a child aged 5 years or older with severe immunosuppression (CD4 +  < 200 cells/µL) to improve CD4 +  values by 50 cells/µL or greater above baseline within the first year of therapy Immunologic decline includes a sustained decline of 5 percentage points in CD4 +  percentage below pretherapy baseline at any age, or decline to below pretherapy baseline in absolute CD4 +  cell count in children who are aged 5 years and older. Clinical failure includes all of the following: Growth failure Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration Serious or recurrent infection and illness Breastfeeding In the United States and other parts of the world where replacement feeding is affordable, feasible, acceptable, sustainable, and safe, breastfeeding by HIV-infected women (including those receiving antiretroviral drugs) is not recommended. [ 3]  Observational data and randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that infant prophylaxis (primarily using daily infant nevirapine) during breastfeeding significantly decreases the risk of postnatal transmission in breast milk and that maternal triple-drug prophylaxis during breastfeeding may likewise decrease postnatal infection. [ 19,  48]  The results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial confirm that nevirapine prophylaxis via breastfeeding infants up to age 6 months provides protection from transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child. [ 49]  Both infant nevirapine prophylaxis and maternal triple-drug prophylaxis during breastfeeding may be associated with the development of antiretroviral drug resistance in infants who become infected despite prophylaxis. [ 3]  Drug interactions with antiretroviral drugs Antiretroviral drug (ARD) regimens often contain 3 or more agents. In addition, other drugs are typically required to manage the numerous infectious and systemic consequences of AIDS. Therefore, the likelihood of drug interactions increases. The outcome of the drug interactions may reduce or eliminate the efficacy or increase the toxicity of 1 or both drugs. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of interactions is essential to minimize or prevent adverse effects and to prevent inadequate treatment. Regarding the mechanisms, drug interactions are classified as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic. Pharmacokinetic interactions alter drug absorption, distribution, or elimination (metabolism, excretion). Pharmacodynamic alterations manifest as additive, synergistic, or antagonistic drug effects. Several ARDs may affect or be affected by absorption kinetics. Didanosine contains an aluminum and magnesium buffer that may affect the absorption of other drugs (eg, ciprofloxacin). Delavirdine, atazanavir, and rilpivirine are poorly absorbed when the pH of the GI tract increases. Many ARD pharmacokinetic interactions alter the cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic enzyme system. Cytochromes are metabolic enzymes in the liver, and CYP denotes the specific enzyme. The CYP system is classified into families, 3 of which are important in humans: CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3. Further delineation into subfamilies is denoted with a capital letter (eg, CYP3A). The nomenclature is completed with the description of individual proteins called isoenzymes, which are delineated with a second number (eg, CYP3A4). Drugs may be substrates, inhibitors, and/or inducers of particular isoenzymes. Substrates are metabolized by means of the CYP system. They may also be classified as inhibitors (ie, those with reversible and competitive action that decreases metabolism) and/or inducers (ie, those with reversible and competitive action that increases metabolism). Inhibitors decrease hepatic metabolism of isoenzyme substrates (ie, increase serum concentrations), whereas inducers increase this metabolism (ie, decrease serum levels). All currently approved protease inhibitors and NNRTIs are metabolized in the CYP system, principally by the 3A4 isoenzyme. Some also induce or inhibit CYP3A4, respectively decreasing or increasing serum levels of the 3A4 substrate. Strong inhibitors (eg, ritonavir) have been used in small doses to increase drug levels (eg, of the lopinavir-ritonavir combination), enhancing the efficacy of those drugs with a low enough dose to limit the risk of adverse effects. Drug interactions among antiretroviral agents may be used to increase and sustain serum levels of one another, enhancing efficacy and decreasing adverse effects (eg, Kaletra, which is a fixed-dose combination product of lopinavir and ritonavir). Other interactions may decrease levels, causing concern about sufficient efficacy. Discussion of drug interactions can be found in  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . Treatment for patients at risk for vertical acquisition Within 6-12 hours of the delivery of a neonate at risk, zidovudine therapy should be started after a baseline CBC count is obtained. Zidovudine should be continued until the infant is 6 weeks of age, when it may be discontinued if all DNA HIV PCR results are negative. If HIV infection is confirmed in the infant, zidovudine monotherapy must be stopped immediately. Prophylaxis and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Although current HAART regimens have substantially and dramatically decreased AIDS-related OIs and deaths, prevention and management of OIs remain critical components of care for HIV-infected children. [ 37]  OIs are typically an indication of severe immune suppression. However, an increased capacity to mount inflammatory reactions as a result of successful HAART may result in the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which manifests as worsening of an existing active, latent, or occult OI. Although IRIS has primarily been reported in adults after initiation of HAART, it also has been reported in children  . IRIS may unmask viable pathogens. Alternatively, in so-called paradoxical IRIS, symptomatic relapse reflects reconstitution of specific T-cell–mediated immunity against persisting antigens from dead organisms; cultures in these cases are sterile. [ 37]  Selected opportunistic pathogens and common sources are as follows: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection from CMV-positive blood products Cryptosporidium  infection from unprocessed ground water or exposure to a young or stray animal Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PCP) from exposure to other individuals with PCP Toxoplasma gondii  infection from cats or ingesting undercooked red meat Tuberculosis (TB) from exposure to infected individuals Antibiotic therapy Tables 2 and 3 below summarize the antibiotics used for primary and secondary prophylaxis of opportunistic infections and their appropriate dosages. Antibiotic prophylaxis does not guarantee protection, and opportunistic infections should be appropriately included in the differential diagnosis for all HIV-infected patients. Several antibiotics used for prophylaxis have clinically significant adverse interactions with antiretroviral agents. For example, rifampin and rifabutin reduce the effectiveness and increase the toxicity of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Also, isoniazid is hepatotoxic and may interact poorly with protease inhibitors that are hepatotoxic. Table 2.

Pneumocystis pneumonia Prophylaxis is the most important measure for decreasing the incidence of PCP, it but does not guarantee protection. Table 4 below delineates the CD4 +  indications for starting prophylaxis with regard to the patient's age or status. Table 4. CD4 +  -Based Indications for Starting PCP Prophylaxis Age or Status  CD4 +  Count, cells/mL  CD4 +  Percentage  6 wk to 1 y Any Any 1-2 y < 750 < 15 2-5 y < 500 < 15 >5 y < 200 < 15 Previous PCP infection Any Any PCP prophylaxis should be started in all infants aged 6 weeks who were born to HIV-infected mothers. It should be continued until HIV infection has been ruled out. Viral infection Previous CMV infection or CMV retinitis requires secondary prophylaxis with ganciclovir 5 mg/kg/day IV, or valganciclovir, or an implant delivering sustained-release ganciclovir or cidofovir. Severe or frequent recurrences of herpes simplex require prophylaxis with acyclovir 80 mg/kg/d given by mouth 2 or 4 times day. Varicella or herpes zoster should be treated with IV acyclovir 500 mg/m 2 /dose 3 times a day for 7 days. Fungal infection Candida Thrush occurs in a third of patients with non–category C disease and in one half of patients with category C disease. Candidal esophagitis is an AIDS-defining condition and can result in severe dysphagia and anorexia; the diagnosis can be confirmed with endoscopy. Disseminated systemic fungemia is rare, but indwelling catheters and neutropenia increase a patient's susceptibility. Primary prophylaxis is not generally recommended, but prophylaxis after repeated infections may be helpful. Prophylactic treatment is used in severe recurrent cases, but prolonged prophylaxis can lead to resistance. Nystatin may not be helpful in managing repeated thrush or cutaneous infections, and topical clotrimazole or miconazole may be needed. Fluconazole, itraconazole, or ketoconazole may be needed if topical treatments fail or if candidal esophagitis develops. Candidal esophagitis recalcitrant to treatment with azole compounds and disseminated disease should be treated with amphotericin. Cryptosporidium Cryptosporidium infections cause chronic, secretory, watery diarrhea that may be large in volume. Maintaining an adequate fluid balance is most important and may be challenging. A unique parasitophorous vacuole in the host cell shelters the parasite from antimicrobial drugs. Control of the infection can be difficult because no curative therapy exists. The best treatment is prevention and good immunity. Avoidance of unfiltered tap water may have some value in prevention. Cryptococcus Cryptococcal meningitis is uncommon in children, though it should be ruled out when symptoms and/or signs of meningitis are observed or when fever without a clear source causes severe headache. CSF samples should be examined with India ink stain, and the presence of cryptococcal antigen in serum and CSF should be determined. Treatment with amphotericin and flucytosine is necessary, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole or itraconazole. Mycobacterial infection M tuberculosis  causes primary pulmonary disease in children and is most likely to affect children with existing lung disease. Extrapulmonary disease can occur, especially when immune function is decreased, and it may be present with or without pulmonary disease. Fever, cough, and tachypnea are common presenting symptoms. PPD testing is useful only if the findings are positive, and it should not be used as a diagnostic method. Gastric aspirates, induced sputum samples, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens are necessary, and susceptibility testing should be performed. Initial therapy should involve 4 drugs: isoniazid, rifampin or rifabutin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin. Therapy should continue for 1 year if the isolate is drug susceptible or more than 1 year if the isolate is multidrug resistant. Rifampin and rifabutin interact with protease inhibitors, requiring an alteration in HAART. Children younger than 4 years should not be treated with ethambutol because of possible optic neuritis. Multidrug-resistant TB is highly prevalent among HIV-infected individuals. It is associated with a poor prognosis. Efavirenz is effective against HIV in children who are also being treated for TB, according to a study by van Dijk et al. The study population consisted of 114 HIV-infected children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg: 45 children who were also being treated for TB received an efavirenz-based ART regimen; a second group of 69 children, including 7 who were being treated for TB, received an ART regimen using nevirapine. At the initiation of ART, the children treated with efavirenz had a lower CD4 +  percentage and weight-for-age z-score than did the nevirapine group. Nevertheless, improvement with the efavirenz-based regimen was such that the CD4 +  percentage and z-score for both groups were comparable at 2-year follow-up. [ 50]  MAC infection Disseminated  M avium-intracellulare  complex (MAC) infection is not uncommon in children with clinically significant disease progression, and a low CD4 +  count is a major risk factor for MAC disease. MAC infection is second only to PCP among the most common opportunistic infections in children with AIDS, occurring in 6-15% of children with HIV infection. This percentage increases to 24% in children with CD4 +  counts of less than 100 cells/mL. In the United States, MAC infection may be more common in the South than elsewhere. MAC is ubiquitous, commonly existing in water, soil, and household environments. In some individuals, colonization may occur before infection. Person-to-person transmission has not been documented. Although localized pulmonary disease is the common form of infection in hosts not infected with HIV, localized disease is uncommon in HIV-infected individuals, and disseminated disease is typical. Disseminated MAC infections commonly cause fever, night sweats, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss. Anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are also common. Involvement of the bone marrow may produce neutropenia. GI symptoms are common in some presentations. Abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and diarrhea with associated malabsorption may be common, but elevated transaminase levels are not common. CT or MRI may reveal general intestinal lymphadenopathy. Sputum, stool, and blood acid-fast cultures should be obtained when the presence of MAC is suspected. The reticuloendothelial system is a common reservoir for mycobacteria, though the bone marrow, GI tract, lungs, adrenals, and kidneys may also be affected. Control of a MAC infection requires at least 2 or 3 antibiotics, but more may be necessary if clinical symptoms do not resolve. Early detection and treatment is most effective. Exposure to antibiotics before treatment suggests that other agents may be more effective than those previously used. In addition, a lack of a response to a regimen may indicate the need to empirically change antibiotics instead of simply adding antibiotics, as drug resistance can develop rapidly. Although polyantimicrobial therapy may be useful, toxicity is more common with this approach. Initial regimens may include macrolides, rifabutin, and ethambutol. Rifabutin interacts with several protease inhibitors, and ethambutol is not generally used in children younger than 4 years because of the possible development of optic neuritis. However, ethambutol is the only choice in many situations, and it is used when indicated. Amikacin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin may also be used for treatment. The best treatment is effective HAART with immune reconstitution, which increases the CD4 +  count. Blood cultures should be obtained at regular intervals until the results are negative and the susceptibilities of identified organisms are determined. Treatment must be continued indefinitely. Prophylaxis is extremely important. Table 5 indicates the CD4 +  count at which prophylaxis should be started with regard to the patient's age. Table 5. CD4 +  -Based Indications for MAC Prophylaxis Age or Status  CD4 +  Count, Cells/mL  < 1y < 750 1-2 y < 500 2-6 y < 75 > 6 y < 50 Previous infection Any Clarithromycin administered for MAC prophylaxis may also protect the patient against  Cryptosporidium  infection. Nitazoxanide is being investigated for treatment of cryptosporidiosis in patients with AIDS. Other drugs, such as paromomycin, azithromycin, and hyperimmune bovine colostrum have been used with suboptimal results. Octreotide must be used with caution because it can slow diarrhea but not clear the infection. Pancreatitis and/or bowel infarction may develop. Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis is a rare CNS infection in children. When it occurs, it is usually acquired congenitally. Specific immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M titers, as well as head ultrasonography to detect CNS lesions, should be performed in neonates with risk of congenital infection or in whom it is suspected. Treatment with pyrimethamine, folinic acid, and sulfadiazine or clindamycin is required when infection occurs. Screening for opportunistic infections All HIV-infected children should be screened for certain opportunistic infections. The patient and all family members should undergo yearly TB screening. CMV infection accelerates HIV progression in infants. At birth, positive findings on urine culture can help guide later management. Cultures not obtained immediately after birth may imply colonization and not congenital infection. CMV infection should be treated only if it is symptomatic. Toxoplasmosis, syphilis, rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex (TORCH syndrome) are not common during gestation in women with well-controlled HIV infection. However, women with poorly controlled HIV infection or neonates who have growth retardation at birth should be screened for TORCH infections. Patients with AIDS not uncommonly carry toxoplasmosis, and this infection may be transmitted in utero if the mother is severely immunosuppressed during pregnancy. Assessment of immunologic function Immunologic function should be assessed in high-risk patients. Immunoglobulin levels should be checked every 3-6 months. Hypogammaglobulinemia is defined as an immunoglobulin G level of less than 2.5 g/L. Humoral immune function can be checked by measuring specific antibody titers after immunization. Cellular immune function is checked by using a subcutaneous candidal control. Children with hypogammaglobulinemia, humoral immune dysfunction, or more than 2 serious bacterial infections in a year should be given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 400 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Treatment for Hematopoietic Disturbances Thrombocytopenia is common in HIV infection, and platelet production generally decreases regardless of the platelet count. Anemia can result from HIV infection or its treatment. Neutropenia is relatively common in advanced disease and creates a clinically significant risk for infection. Thrombocytopenia Immune-mediated platelet destruction develops in approximately 20% of children with HIV infection. In children with advanced disease, severe thrombocytopenia may need to be managed. The platelet count may transiently increase with IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), interferon (IFN)-alfa, corticosteroids, or anti-Rh immunoglobulin. IVIG is the treatment of choice. Regimens include IVIG 1-2 g/kg/day for 2-5 days. Three million units of IFN-alfa administered 3 times per week increases the platelet count in 50% of adults after 3 weeks. A 4-week course of prednisone 1-2 mg/kg followed by a 2- to 4-week taper is an alternative, but the immunosuppressive adverse effects must be considered carefully. Anti-Rh immunoglobulin is useful in Rh-positive patients who have not undergone splenectomy, and it is relatively inexpensive. A 1- to 2-g decrease in the hemoglobin level occurs, which limits use of this therapy in patients with anemia. In most patients, 25 mcg/kg administered IV on 2 consecutive days with repeated doses of IV anti-Rh or intramuscular (IM) anti-D every 2-4 weeks increases the platelet count. As an alternative, 6-13 mcg/kg IM administered every week also produces a reasonable increase in the platelet count. More long-lasting responses can be achieved with zidovudine or danazol treatment or splenectomy. In most adults, high-dose zidovudine can reverse HIV-related idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (HIV-ITP). Treatment of HIV infection, especially with zidovudine, appears to improve the platelet count and platelet production. In adults, danazol 400-800 mg daily increases the platelet count in 1-2 months. Splenectomy is an effective long-term treatment. Although splenectomy is not associated with an increased mortality rate, the risk of fulminant infections with encapsulated bacteria increases. Anemia Iatrogenic anemia is not uncommon, and HIV infection often suppresses bone marrow, serum erythropoietin levels, and responses of the bone marrow to erythropoietin. An infectious or neoplastic agent may cause new-onset anemia. A standard workup for anemia should be performed along with a determination of the erythropoietin level, reticulocyte count, and indirect bilirubin level. A high reticulocyte count indicates a good bone marrow response. When accompanied by a high indirect bilirubin level, hemolytic anemia should be suspected. In the setting of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the use of sulfonamides, dapsone, or oxidant drugs can cause iatrogenic erythrocyte hemolysis. A low indirect bilirubin level indicates a response to acute blood loss or recent replacement of a necessary cofactor. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can cause hemolytic anemia and are associated with thrombocytopenia and fragmented RBCs on smears. Although the prevalence of erythrocyte autoantibodies is high in HIV-infected patients, especially those with hypergammaglobulinemia, the rate of hemolysis by this mechanism is low. Hemophagocytic syndrome occurs when macrophages in the bone marrow phagocytose erythrocytes. A low reticulocyte count indicates bone marrow suppression, ineffective erythropoiesis, or a myelophthisic process. Vitamin B-12 or folic acid deficiency produces a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and indirect bilirubin level. Patients with HIV are especially at risk for these deficiencies because of poor nutrition and poor small-bowel function. As many as 33% of patients with HIV have a negative vitamin B-12 balance. Folic acid deficiency causes the production of large oval erythrocytes, hypersegmented polymorphonucleocytes, and pancytopenia. Vitamin B-12 deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with high cortical dysfunction. Before treatment is started with supplemental parenteral vitamin B-12 and oral folic acid, serum folate and vitamin B-12 levels must be measured. A low or normal indirect bilirubin value suggests secondary myelosuppression or neoplastic marrow infiltration. A high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) indicates iatrogenic pharmaceutical suppression of erythropoiesis. A low MCV suggests iron deficiency anemia. A normal MCV suggests HIV anemia, anemia related to chronic disease, an infectious etiology, or neoplastic marrow invasion. Parvovirus B19 and many pharmaceutical agents cause neutropenia in addition to anemia. Ancillary hematologic laboratory tests may help clarify the differential diagnosis, and an investigation of an infectious etiology may be warranted if the CD4 +  count is low. Several etiologies may be involved, resulting in laboratory values that may not be correlated with a particular type of anemia. Clinical evaluation and correlation with laboratory values is necessary. Bone marrow biopsy may be necessary if laboratory and clinical findings are inconclusive. Serum erythropoietin levels of less than 500 IU/L and anemia due to bone marrow suppression as a result of infection, inflammation, or pharmaceutical agents should be managed with erythropoietin. Other causes of anemia must be ruled out and managed before erythropoietin is given. Erythropoietin should be started at a dosage of 100 U/kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week; this may be increased to 200 U/kg/dose. After the hematocrit returns to normal, dosing should be decreased to once every week or every other week to maintain a stable hematocrit. Adverse effects include pain at the injection site and fever. Supplemental iron should always be given with erythropoietin therapy. Neutropenia Neutropenia is relatively common in advanced HIV disease. In 25% of patients with moderate neutropenia, bacterial infections develop, most often within 24 hours of the onset of neutropenia. The following myelosuppressive drugs—especially zidovudine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ganciclovir—can induce neutropenia: Zidovudine Lamivudine Didanosine Stavudine Ganciclovir Valganciclovir Foscarnet Flucytosine Amphotericin Sulfonamides Trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Pyrimethamine Pentamidine Infectious agents such as parvovirus B19 can cause myelosuppression, as can invasive neoplastic processes of the marrow. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are used to treat neutropenia and to promote granulocyte production and function. GM-CSF has more adverse effects than G-CSF, and it promotes viral replication. However, GM-CSF does not increase the viral load if it is used with ART. G-CSF is started at a dosage of 5 mcg/kg/day, and it is given until neutropenia resolves. Titration to once or twice per week is typical. Adverse effects of G-CSF are minimal and include bone pain and elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase levels. GM-CSF is started at a dosage of 5 mcg/kg/d given subcutaneously for 5 days and then titrated to effect. Adverse effects include flulike symptoms, myalgias, bone pain, fatigue, and fever. Hospital Admission Based on the patient's living arrangements and stage of infection, inpatient care may be warranted at some time during the patient's illness. The extensive testing required to rule out an underlying infection or a malignancy may be easiest performed if the child is admitted to a health care facility. If an infection or a malignancy is detected, hospital admission may be appropriate. For example, if intravenous antibiotics are given, a child is usually admitted to the hospital. A serious reaction to an antiviral drug may also mandate hospitalization to follow up on the progression of the reaction and to observe the patient if new drugs are begun. Diet Malnutrition with an accompanying failure to thrive is not uncommon in children infected with HIV. The patient's dietary habits should be reviewed on a regular basis, and a nutritional specialist should be involved in the patient's treatment. Poor appetite results in poor nutritional intake. Appetite stimulants can be useful. High-energy, high-protein nutritional supplements are commonly needed. Caretakers must be instructed to avoid giving the child any food or water that has a high risk of being contaminated with any infectious agent. HIV and accompanying opportunistic infections can worsen GI symptoms. Nasogastric, nasojejunal, and/or gastrostomy tubes may be needed to support the patient's nutritional and fluid status. Gastrostomy tubes are well tolerated, and they are often more comfortable than nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes. Parenteral hyperalimentation may be necessary when the patient's GI tract cannot support substantial feedings. Treatment Compliance Medication compliance is a central issue. This is particularly important with regard to ART because missing even 1 dose can easily lead to subtherapeutic levels of many drugs used in ART. Subtherapeutic levels promote the development of drug resistance. The treatment regimen may be difficult. Patients must take multiple doses of several ARDs every day, as well as prophylactic antibiotics and supplemental vitamins. Therefore, the risk of missing a dose is high. New ARDs are being developed to simplify the medical regimen. The simplest dosing regimen should be carefully selected to help avoid this pitfall. Noncompliance with prescribed medications is multifactorial and major in some populations. In general, children do not like to take medications, especially if they taste bad. Several drugs have an unpleasant taste. Adverse effects (eg, GI upset, diarrhea, allergy) may cause the caretaker to discontinue a medication without informing the physician. Many drugs can cause compliance problems, even in the most reliable individuals. The caretaker or child should bring the medications to each clinic visit. The bottles should be checked against a list of prescribed medications kept in the chart. The caretaker or patient should be questioned regarding the particular time and method of administration, and he or she should be asked to state the names of the medications without referring to the bottles. Although some caretakers cannot perfectly complete this task, they may still be giving the medications correctly. This assessment method allows the physician to judge the caretaker's familiarity with the medications and to detect any problems with drug administration. Known adverse effects of drugs should be directly addressed. Some caretakers or patients are frightened or embarrassed to disclose adverse effects that may be preventing them from properly using the medications. For example, though a patient may be taking a medication regularly, it may induce frequent vomiting, which affects drug delivery. Adolescent patients may avoid taking the medications at school to prevent their peers from knowing about their disease. Partial compliance can be worse than no compliance because resistance occurs when drugs are given at subtherapeutic doses. Drug resistance develops rapidly. If the patient is not taking a medication, the virus does not develop resistance to it, and the medication is still useful for future treatment of the virus. Administering medications with chocolate or peanut butter can help. Some medications can also be mixed in chocolate milk or pudding. If such a technique is used, proper dental hygiene is important to wash out the sugar after a drug is administered. Placement of gastrostomy tube for drug administration is a feasible option in children who cannot be compliant. Such a device also is useful for nutritional supplementation. This option must be planned in advance because the potentially tenuous condition of children with advanced HIV can make surgical procedures risky. A home visiting nurse or a family member experienced in healthcare may be able to assist and instruct primary caregivers in giving medications. Deterrence/Prevention The risk of vertical transmission may be reduced. Most children are infected by means of vertical transmission. Proper treatment of the mother during pregnancy and delivery and proper treatment of the neonate can reduce the risk of vertical transmission. Prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal treatment along with elective cesarean delivery lower the transmission rate to as low as 2%. Risk factors for vertical transmission are divided into the 4 categories, as shown in Table 6. Table 6. Risk Factors for Vertical Transmission Period  Factors That Increase Risk  Factors That Decrease Risk  Prenatal Acute HIV infection Viral load >10,000 Cigarette smoking Illicit IV drug use Viral load < 1000 Zidovudine treatment Neutralizing antibodies Perinatal Rupture of membranes for >4 h Chorioamnionitis Emergency cesarean delivery Surgical delivery Episiotomy Use of scalp electrodes Elective cesarean delivery with zidovudine treatment Neonatal Prematurity Low birth weight First-born twin Full-term Second-born twin Postdelivery Breastfeeding ART Transmission can occur during 3 periods: prenatal or in utero, perinatal and delivery, and postnatal. Prenatal transmission is implicated in 15-38% of vertically acquired HIV infections. Most vertical infections occur during delivery. Although the concentration of HIV in the cervicovaginal secretions is lower in women with lower viral loads, HIV particles exist in the cervicovaginal secretions of women with undetectable viral loads. Any factor that reduces contact between the neonate and maternal blood or cervicovaginal secretions reduces vertical transmission. This observation is supported by the decreased transmission rates noted with elective cesarean delivery. However, this protective effect occurs only when women were treated with zidovudine during pregnancy. The postpartum complication rate increases with elective cesarean delivery. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether regimens involving highly active ART (HAART) can substantially reduce vertical transmission during vaginal delivery and thereby improve morbidity and mortality rates for both mother and child. Postnatal vertical transmission occurs with breastfeeding; the transmission incidence is 0.7% per month. Although recommendations state that women infected with HIV should not breastfeed, the World Health Organization advises women in developing countries to breastfeed because death rates related to infectious diarrhea and dehydration are higher than those related to AIDS. The CDC has approved the following regimen to reduce vertical HIV transmission: Antepartum: Administer zidovudine 300 mg orally (PO) twice a day and other appropriate ART, usually the addition of lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. For women who present during the prenatal period, zidovudine should be started regardless of the use of other antiretroviral agents and a history of zidovudine resistance Intrapartum: Continuously infuse zidovudine intravenously (IV) at a rate of 1 mg/kg/hour for women who present in labor Neonates: Give zidovudine, starting within the first 6-12 hours of life and continuing until the patient is 6 weeks old Unfortunately, antepartum treatment is not without risk to the fetus. In a study of HIV-negative infants born to HIV-positive mothers, Lipshultz et al concluded that fetal exposure to ART was associated with various cardiac effects, including reduced left ventricular (LV) dimension, LV mass, and septal wall thickness z-scores, as well as increased LV fractional shortening and contractility up to age 2 years. [ 20]  These effects are more pronounced in girls than in boys Exposure to ART in utero may impair myocardial growth while improving depressed LV function. A large-scale clinical trial (known as HPTN 052) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that immediate treatment of HIV-infected individuals with oral antiretroviral drugs reduced the risk of transmitting the virus to their uninfected sexual partners by 96%. [ 51]  Postexposure prophylaxis The CDC has recommended basic and expanded HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. For details, see the  Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis . Also see the Medscape Reference articles  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection  and  Body Fluid Exposures . An overview of the CDC recommendations for PEP are as follows: Basic PEP 2-drug regimen - Zidovudine plus lamivudine, zidovudine plus emtricitabine, tenofovir plus lamivudine, or tenofovir plus emtricitabine Alternative basic PEP regimen - Lamivudine plus stavudine, lamivudine plus didanosine, emtricitabine plus stavudine, or emtricitabine plus didanosine Expanded PEP regimen - Basic PEP regimen plus lopinavir-ritonavir An alternative expanded PEP regimen includes the basic PEP regimen plus one of the following: Atazanavir with or without ritonavir Fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir Indinavir with or without ritonavir Saquinavir with or without ritonavir Nelfinavir Efavirenz Use of nevirapine for PEP is generally not recommended because of a risk of early onset rash and severe hepatotoxicity. HIV vaccine A study from Thailand suggests a possible benefit of vaccines in heterosexuals at risk for HIV-1 transmission. [ 52]  In the randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by Rerks-Ngarm et al, 16,402 healthy participants aged 18-30 years received either 4 priming injections of recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) plus 2 booster shots of recombinant glycoprotein 120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) or placebo. In the per-protocol analysis, which excluded subjects who seroconverted during the vaccination series, the vaccine efficacy was 26.2%. In the modified-intention-to-treat analysis, which excluded subjects who had baseline HIV-1 infection, the vaccine efficacy was 31.2%. However, the 95% confidence intervals in these analyses were extremely wide (-13.3 to 51.9 and 1.1 to 52.1, respectively), which precludes concluding that the vaccine had proven efficacy. [ 52]  Among study subjects who developed HIV-1 infection, viremia and CD4+ T cell counts were unchanged by vaccination. This suggests that, if infection did occur, there was no apparent immunologic benefit from having received the vaccine. Immunizations Immunizations for most childhood diseases and other preventable pathogens should be given to the child with HIV infection. All typical childhood vaccines should be given, with the exception of live vaccines in selected children. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine should be given instead of the live oral poliovirus vaccine, though this is a consideration only in developing countries where live oral vaccines are used. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine should be given to all children whose disease is not in CDC immune category 3. The second dose should be given as soon as 1 month after the first dose to ensure early seroconversion. If a recent measles epidemic has occurred, the measles or mono-measles vaccine should be administered as early as possible to all children, except those whose disease is in CDC immune category 3. Pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine (PCV 7) is recommended for all HIV-infected children aged 2–59 months. For children 24-59 months who have already received PPV 23, 2 doses of PCV 7 administered at least 2 months apart are recommended. Administering PCV 7 to older children with high-risk conditions, such as HIV infection, is not contraindicated. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV 23) should be given to children at 2 years of age, with 1 revaccination 3-5 years later. Influenza vaccine should be given yearly to all children older than 6 months and to family members of the patient. Administer 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine at a minimum interval of 3 months to HIV-infected children 12 months of age or older in CDC clinical class N, A, or B with CD4 +  T-lymphocyte counts 15% or higher and without evidence of varicella. Varicella vaccine was previously recommended for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV-infected children (CDC clinical class N or A) with age-specific CD4 +  T-lymphocyte counts of 25% or higher. Otherwise, varicella vaccination is strictly forbidden, and exposure to varicella should be treated with intramuscular (IM) varicella-zoster immunoglobulin within 72 hours of exposure. Measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine should not be administered as a substitute for the component vaccines when HIV-infected children are being vaccinated. No data are available regarding the safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy of this combination vaccine in HIV-infected children. All children should receive hepatitis A vaccine at age 12-23 months. Vaccination should be completed according to the approved schedules and integrated into the routine childhood vaccination schedule. Children who are not vaccinated by the age of 2 years can be vaccinated at subsequent visits. The potential risks and benefits of administering rotavirus vaccine to infected infants must be considered because immunocompromised hosts sometimes have severe, prolonged, and even fatal rotavirus gastroenteritis. However, safety or efficacy data are not available for the administration of rotavirus vaccine to infants with HIV/AIDS and other clinical manifestations of HIV infection. Data from clinical trials are insufficient to support the administration of rotavirus vaccine to infants with indeterminate HIV status who were born to mothers with HIV/AIDS. Use of the combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines (Tdap) is not contraindicated in HIV-infected children. The immunogenicity of Tdap in persons with immunosuppression has not been studied and could be suboptimal. Tdap can be administered to children and adolescents aged 11-18 years at an interval of less than 5 years after Td vaccination, as the benefit of providing protection against pertussis is likely to be increased. Data from a Canadian study of children and adolescents support the safety of an interval as short as about 2 years between Td and Tdap vaccinations. ACIP recommends routine immunization with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (serogroups A, C, W, and Y; Menactra or Menveo) for persons aged ≥2 months with HIV infection. HIV- infected children aged <2 years should receive the vaccine in accordance with the age-appropriate, licensed, multidose schedule (ie, Menveo at aged 2, 4, 6, and 12 months). Persons aged ≥2 years with HIV infection who have not been previously vaccinated should receive a 2-dose primary series of MenACWY conjugate vaccine (Menactra or Menveo). Persons aged ≥2 years with HIV infection who have been previously vaccinated with 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a booster dose at the earliest opportunity, provided at least 8 weeks have elapsed since the previous dose, and then continue to receive boosters at the appropriate interval throughout life. [ 53]  Consultations An infectious disease specialist usually provides primary care and coordinates the care of the other specialists. In general, assembling a team of specialists is the best approach for managing the medical care of a child with HIV infection. A human development specialist, a nutritionist, a psychologist, and a case manager should be involved in the treatment of every child with HIV infection. Examinations by specialists should occur routinely. Obtain a neurodevelopmental evaluation every 3-6 months. The patient should follow up with an ophthalmologist every 6-12 months. Obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation for CMV, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis infections, as well as for corneal ulceration, which is often secondary to underlying nutritional deficits. Obtain dental examinations at age 1-2 years, with follow-up every 3-6 months. Obtain an audiologic evaluation at age 2 years or sooner if concern exists. Surgical consultation may be indicated in patients requiring central venous access for long-term parenteral medication or hyperalimentation. Placement of subcutaneous ports is common in children requiring long-term parenteral therapy, but the risks of placing such a line should be weighed against the possible need for recurrent replacement because of repeated line infections. A cardiologist, endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, nephrologist, neurologist, pulmonologist, and mental health specialist should be consulted when necessary. Long-Term Monitoring Children with HIV infection require regular monitoring, with intervals determined by age and clinical status (eg, every 2 wk initially in infancy, with an increase in intervals as the child ages and the immune status stabilizes). In younger children, evaluations should occur every 1-6 months. In older children, a review of systems is advised every 3 months and a physical evaluation should be performed every year. CD4 +  counts must be checked every 3-6 months. Accurate height and weight documentation at each visit is important because HIV infection is known to adversely affect growth rates in children. Children with improved height growth velocity may be less likely to exhibit virologic or immunologic failure and less likely to have clinical disease progression. [ 54]  A decrease in the growth velocity should alert the clinician to worsening of the underlying disease or inadequate nutrition. Dietary habits should be reviewed at each clinical visit. Aggressive nutritional management prevents growth failure and improves immune function. Most children with HIV infection have some developmental delay. Developmental assessment and therapy (including physical, occupational, and speech therapies) should be available. Social support staff should continually reevaluate the child's support system. Children with HIV infection have many issues and need extra support from inside and outside the family. Every attempt should be made to support the efforts of a caring family and child. Monitor CD4 +  levels or percentages in infants or patients newly diagnosed with HIV at 3- to 4-month intervals to assess patients' immune status. In children younger than 5 years, the 2010 Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children recommends using CD4 percentages over absolute CD4 counts for monitoring disease progression because of inherent age-related changes in absolute CD4 counts. [ 3]  Other laboratory values should be monitored as follows: Every 3 months: Evaluate the HIV viral load and complete blood count; additional laboratory tests may be needed depending on the ART regimen Every 3-6 months: Check liver function and amylase, lipase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels Every 6 months: Perform quantitative immunoglobulin tests and urinalysis and evaluate the fasting lipid profile Every year: Perform chest radiography and cytomegalovirus (CMV) and  Toxoplasma  serologic tests if baseline values are negative Maintain an established vaccination schedule in children who are HIV positive to protect them against vaccine-preventable illnesses (see Immunizations). Obtain a cerebrospinal fluid analysis in patients with neurologic disease (based on risk factors of the area and the clinical presentation of the child). Differential Diagnoses Diagnostic Considerations Older children and young teenagers can have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS without a history of immunodeficiency or severe illness. Fever of unknown origin, recurrent infection, growth failure, or developmental regression without an obvious etiology should increase the index of suspicion for HIV infection. The failure to complete neonatal testing is another pitfall. The process to verity that an at-risk neonate does not have HIV infection is complex. Too often, follow-up tests are not performed if initial results are negative. Prenatal HIV tests are often performed, but the results may not be followed up, especially in low-risk women. Nonopportunistic infections Like most children, children with HIV are susceptible to common pathogens. Diseases caused by such pathogens should be high in the list of differential diagnoses for these children. Of course, the particular child's medical history guides the differential diagnosis. For example, chronic lung disease requires special consideration of atypical respiratory pathogens, such as  Pseudomonas  or  Xanthomonas  species. One of the challenges with children who are infected with HIV is that they are more likely than others to have recurrent infections, which cause them to undergo repeat treatment with many broad-spectrum antibiotics. This antibiotic exposure increases the risk of their developing resistant pathogens. Therefore, infection with penicillin-resistant pneumococci is not uncommon in children with recurrent ear infections. Common recurrent infections are otitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Recurrent otitis is observed in 55% and 35% of HIV-infected children with AIDS and those without AIDS, respectively. Children with recurrent bacterial infections and CD4 +  counts of less than 200 X 10 9 /L may benefit from monthly IVIG. Moderate and severe neutropenia increases the risk for bacterial infection by 2.3- and 7.9-fold, respectively. Other risk factors for bacterial infection include neutropenia within the last 3 months and central venous line access. Constitutional Growth Delay Lymphadenopathy Malnutrition Nutritional Considerations in Failure to Thrive Pediatric Autoimmune and Chronic Benign Neutropenia Pediatric Bruton Agammaglobulinemia Pediatric Chronic Anemia Pediatric Common Variable Immunodeficiency Pediatric Malabsorption Syndromes Pediatric Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy Medication Medication Summary Antiretroviral drugs (ARDs) are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). ARD monotherapy does not produce sustained clinical benefits, such as improved survival. This failure is partly due to the development of drug-resistant variants of HIV. Resistance develops rapidly during monotherapy, and cross-resistance among related drugs is common. Combination therapy with ARDs (a strategy analogous to the treatment of TB and other infectious diseases) has improved efficacy, minimized toxicity, and delayed drug resistance. Six classes of ARDs currently exist, as follows: Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Integrase inhibitors (IIs) Fusion inhibitors (FIs) Chemokine receptor antagonists (CRAs) Initial therapy should be started with a combination of 3 ARDs, including a backbone of 2 NRTIs  plus  an NNRTI,  or  2 NRTIs  plus  a protease inhibitor. [ 3]  As of January 2016, more than 19 ARDs have been approved for pediatric usage and more than 15 are available as a pediatric formulation or capsule size. Nucleoside or Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Class Summary NRTIs are nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor analogs with antiretroviral activity. They are indicated for the treatment of HIV infection, and they delay the progression of the disease.  Abacavir (ABC, Ziagen) Patients and parents must be cautioned about the risk of serious hypersensitivity reaction. Provide a medication guide and warning card.  Didanosine (ddI, dideoxyinosine, Videx, Videx EC) This agent is a purine nucleoside analog with antiviral activity. Lamivudine (3TC, Epivir, Epivir HBV) Lamivudine is a dideoxynucleoside analog with antiretroviral activity. In combination with oral zidovudine, it produces substantial and sustained increases in CD4+ counts and decreases in viral load in HIV-infected patients. It is also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hepatitis B. Stavudine (d4T, Zerit) Stavudine is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analog active against HIV-1. Zidovudine (ZDV, AZT, Retrovir) This agent is a thymidine analog that inhibits viral replication. It inhibits activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with natural substrate for use by and incorporation into viral DNA. Emtricitabine (FTC, Emtriva) A synthetic nucleoside cytosine analog, emtricitabine competes with deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate and incorporates into viral DNA, causing chain termination.  Tenofovir (TDF, Viread) This antiretroviral agent used in treatment of AIDS inhibits activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by causing DNA chain termination. It is administered as prodrug bis-isopropoxycarbonyloxymethyl ester derivative of tenofovir, which is converted, in various enzymatic processes, to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5'-monophosphate. Administration with a high-fat meal enhances bioavailability. Prolonged intracellular levels allows for once-daily dosing.  Etravirine (Intelence) Indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents (ART) for treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-experienced patients with evidence of viral replication and HIV-1 strains resistant to a NNRTIs and other antiretroviral agents.  Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Class Summary NNRTIs inhibit both DNA-directed and RNA-directed polymerase functions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The different sites of action of nonnucleoside and nucleoside inhibitors suggest potential synergistic effects of these agents and their potential activity against nucleoside-resistant HIV strains.  Delavirdine (DLV, Rescriptor) Delavirdine is a potent NNRTI used primarily in combination regimens. Efavirenz (DMP-266, EFV, Sustiva) Efavirenz is used only in combination regimens. Nevirapine (NVP, Viramune, Viramune XR) Nevirapine is indicated for use in combination with other ARDs for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Rilpivirine (Edurant) NNRTI indicated in combination with other ARTs for treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adolescents aged 12-17 y with HIV-1 RNA ≤100,000 copies/mL. Protease Inhibitors Class Summary Protease inhibitors inhibit HIV protease, which is required for HIV replication and the formation of mature, infectious viral particles.  Indinavir (Crixivan, IDV) This agent prevents formation of protein precursors necessary for HIV infection of uninfected cells and viral replication. Nelfinavir (Viracept, NPV) Nelfinavir inhibits HIV-1 protease, resulting in the production of an immature and noninfectious virus. Ritonavir (Norvir, RTV) Ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitor used as part of double or triple therapy with nucleosides and other protease inhibitors. Saquinavir (Invirase) Saquinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor used as part of double or triple therapy with nucleosides and other protease inhibitors. It is available as a 200-mg hard gel cap or 500-mg film-coated tablet. Lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra, LVP/r) Lopinavir inhibits HIV protease and renders enzyme incapable of processing polyprotein precursors, leading to production of noninfectious, immature HIV particles. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A metabolism of lopinavir, increasing plasma levels. This product is available in tablets (200 mg/50 mg LPV/r), pediatric tablets (100 mg/25 mg LPV/r), and PO solution (80 mg/20 mg LPV/r; 42.4% alcohol by volume).  Atazanavir (ATV, Reyataz) Atazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor. It prevents virion maturation by selectively inhibiting Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells.  Darunavir (DRV, TMC-114, Prezista) An HIV-1 protease inhibitor, darunavir selectively inhibits HIV-encoded Gag-Pol polyprotein cleavage in infected cells, preventing formation of mature virus particles. It is indicated to treat HIV disease not responding to other ARDs. Coadminister with low-dose ritonavir (ritonavir-boosted therapy decreases elimination and increases darunavir serum concentration). Darunavir is typically coadministered with other anti-HIV agents (eg, NRTIs). Food increases maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). It is indicated to treat HIV infection in ART–experienced adults (eg, those with HIV-1 strains resistant to >1 protease inhibitor). Fosamprenavir (f-APV, Lexiva) A prodrug of amprenavir (inhibitor of HIV protease), fosamprenavir is rapidly converted to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in vivo. Amprenavir inhibits HIV-1 protease and binds its active site, preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors and resulting in immature, noninfectious viral particles. Tipranavir (TPV, Aptivus) A nonpeptidic protease inhibitor, tipranavir inhibits HIV replication. It is indicated for combination ART of HIV-1 infection in adults with evidence of viral replication and who are highly treatment experienced or who have strains resistant to several protease inhibitors. This agent must be coadministered with ritonavir 200 mg to attain therapeutic levels. It is ineffective if used alone without ritonavir-boosted levels. Results of genotypic or phenotypic testing and/or treatment history should guide use. It is available as 250 mg caps or as PO solution of 100 mg/mL.  Entry and Fusion Inhibitors Class Summary These agents disrupt HIV binding and, ultimately, fusion with host cells. Entry inhibitors bind to CCR5 chemokines coreceptors. Fusion inhibitors bind to the HR1 region of gp41.  Enfuvirtide (T-20, Fuzeon) Enfuvirtide is the sole available fusion inhibitor. It blocks entry of HIV into human immune cells by inhibiting gp41 protein, disrupting viral structural rearrangement to fuse with healthy immune cells and preventing HIV replication. In clinical trials, selected patients with multidrug resistance were twice as likely to achieve undetectable HIV-1 plasma levels (< 40 copies/mL) when enfuvirtide was added to optimized antiretroviral regimens.  Maraviroc (MVC, Selzentry) Maraviroc blocks viral entry via CCR5 co-receptor into host cells, reduces viral load, and increases T-cell counts in CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (ie, R5 virus). This agent is indicated for combination treatment with optimized background therapy in treatment-experienced adults infected with only R5 virus who have evidence of viral replication and have HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple antiretroviral agents. Integrase Inhibitors Class Summary HIV integrase is responsible for the transport and attachment of proviral DNA to host-cell chromosomes, allowing transcription of viral proteins.  Raltegravir (RAL, Isentress) Raltegravir is an HIV-1integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). It is indicated for use in combination therapy regimens for the treatment of HIV infection.  Dolutegravir (Tivicay) Dolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that inhibits catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV encoded enzyme required for viral replication.

				"body": "Editor's Note: The Case Challenge series includes difficult-to-diagnose conditions, some of which are not frequently encountered by most clinicians but are nonetheless important to accurately recognize. Test your diagnostic and treatment skills using the following patient scenario and corresponding questions. If you have a case you would like to suggest for a future Case Challenge, please contact us . Background A 49-year-old Nigerian man is referred to an infectious diseases clinic for evaluation. The patient states that he has been working as a taxi driver in the United States since he arrived in 1991. He discloses that he was diagnosed with HIV over a decade ago, prior to immigrating to the United States, but has never received treatment. In addition, the patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus . He is a nonsmoker and denies illicit drug use. He is separated from his wife and denies having sexual encounters with male partners. His medications include metformin, glipizide, clonidine, amlodipine, lisinopril, and pravastatin. The patient has been depressed since the HIV diagnosis, isolating himself from others. Physical Examination and Workup Physical examination revealed an overweight man with a blood pressure of 169/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 87 beats/min, and oral temperature of 97.2° F. No rashes or other skin lesions or peripheral lymphadenopathy are noted. The remainder of his physical examination was noncontributory. To evaluate for his self-disclosed prior HIV infection diagnosis, HIV-1 viral load, HIV-1/2 serology, and CD4 lymphocyte counts were obtained. His laboratory findings on a return appointment show the following: HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay: Positive CD4 cell count: 752 cells/mm 3 ; 47% HIV-1 RNA quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): Not detected 1 Discussion Figure 1. Patients who have HIV-2 infection have a positive rapid screen but an undetectable HIV-1 RNA RT-PCR. This patient had HIV-2 infection that was discovered with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay test. This finding suggests that the patient may have HIV-2 infection that was discovered with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay test. A confirmatory test is required. Ideally, this would be done by a PCR assay for HIV-2 RNA, but this may be difficult to acquire. A multi-spot assay or other immunological test to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies should be obtained. HIV-2 infection is uncommon in the United States; it is mostly found in West Africa. When suspected HIV-2 infection is encountered, a connection to West Africa should be sought [1,2] HIV-2 cases were first identified in the United States in 1987. [3] As with HIV-1, HIV-2 infection is transferred via blood, sexual contact, and perinatally. HIV-2 is less pathogenic than HIV-1. HIV-2 infection results in lower levels of viremia and immune activation, and is characterized by a longer asymptomatic stage and a slower CD4 cell count decline. [3,4] HIV-2, like HIV-1, was first transferred to human beings from sooty mangabey monkeys living in West Africa. The condition is believed to have been circulating since 1966. Recent data in Gambia and the Ivory Coast indicate that HIV-2 may be as much as 621 times less transmissible than HIV-1. [3] Infections with HIV-1 and HIV-2 differ in their laboratory test findings. Patients who are infected with HIV-2 typically present with higher CD4 cell counts than patients with HIV-1. Patients with HIV-2 infection have a lower viral load than patients with HIV-1 infection. These distinctions are important because HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections typically require different treatment approaches for successful management. The two virus subtypes have helped promote the creation of fourth-generation HIV testing. Third-generation testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by western blots misclassified HIV-2 infection . This testing algorithm missed those with early infection if antibodies had not yet developed. Also, patients with dual infection showed cross-reactivity, and the diagnosis of HIV-2 infection was missed. These tests also showed negative HIV-1 western blot findings, requiring HIV-2 western blot testing. Third-generation testing was also indeterminate in acute HIV-1 infection or chronic HIV-2 infection, requiring further testing. [3] Fourth-generation testing was developed to address these problems. Screening for HIV should be done with an HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combination. If findings are positive, an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be performed. If those results reveal positivity for HIV-2 infection, an HIV-2-specific ELISA, RT-PCR, or western blot test should be performed. [3] Two rapid result tests are available in the United States: the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab combination test (an immunoassay) and the Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combination test (using lateral flow technology). HIV-1 RT-PCR does not detect presence of HIV-2; therefore, patients infected with HIV-2 may have an \"undetectable\" viral load. The New York State Department of Health Wadsworth laboratory and the University of Washington laboratory medicine community services are the only laboratories currently available to assess HIV-2 viral load in the clinical setting. [5] Treatment for HIV-2 infection shows intrinsic resistance to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) and fusion inhibitors. A combination of two nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and a boosted protease inhibitor is recommended for treatment. Treatment data on susceptibility to integrase inhibitors are limited. HIV-2 may use different co-receptors; therefore, CCR5 antagonists may have limited effectiveness. [6] Recommended NRTIs include tenofovir and abacavir. Zidovudine is not recommended because only two mutations are required for resistance to develop. A high level of intrinsic resistance to lamivudine/emtricitabine has also been documented. Protease inhibitors show variable results. The following may be used: Lopinavir Darunavir Saquinavir The following should be avoided: Atazanavir Amprenavir Indinavir Nelfinavir Tipranavir Another differential diagnosis to consider in the presence of a high CD4 cell count and undetectable HIV-1 viral load is that the patient is an \"elite controller.\" Elite controller is a term used to describe patients with HIV infection who have no clinical evidence of viremia. Such patients are uncommon; they usually present with a high CD4 cell count and undetectable viral loads. [3] Elite controllers are theorized to have a lack of susceptibility to HIV infection of CD4 cells, are infected with replication-defective HIV variants, have an efficient immune response to viral replication, or have reduced inflammation. [7] Data support that these individuals mount a strong HIV host response which controls their infection. Most agree that elite controllers downregulate viral replication in lymphoid tissue so that few HIV cells persist, resulting in low HIV RNA and, therefore, fewer infected CD4 cells. [7] In this patient, HIV-2 RNA detection by PCR was performed; RNA was detected but was below the lower limit of quantification. Chronic HIV-2 infection was determined by a positive rapid test for HIV infection and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA viral load but detectable HIV-2 RNA. The patient was started on a boosted protease inhibitor and two NRTIs (tenofovir and abacavir). He has maintained proper control and followed the recommended treatment indications. He remains asymptomatic at last follow-up. 2 ",

Before initiating treatment, health care providers should review the potential teratogenic effects of antiretroviral treatments on the fetus, as well as any other adverse impacts the therapy could have on the fetus or newborn. [ 1,  2,  3]  The decision whether to use antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy should be made by the patient after she has discussed with her health care provider the treatment’s known and potential benefits and risks to herself and her fetus.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that any drug that is systemically absorbed contain information on the drug’s teratogenic effects, as well as information on other effects the agent may have on reproduction and pregnancy.  FDA Pregnancy Categories See the list below: Category A: Adequate and well-controlled studies of pregnant women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy (and no evidence exists of risk during later trimesters)  Category B: Animal reproduction studies fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and adequate, but well-controlled, studies of pregnant women have not been conducted  Category C: Safety in human pregnancy has not been determined; animal studies either are positive for fetal risk or have not been conducted, and the drug should not be used unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus  Category D: There is positive evidence of human fetal risk that is based on adverse-reaction data from investigational or marketing experiences, but the potential benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women might be acceptable despite its potential risks  Category X: Studies in animals or reports of adverse reactions have indicated that the risk associated with the use of the drug for pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit  FDA Pregnancy Categories for Antiretroviral Therapy There are several antiretroviral agents that are used to treat HIV, including nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, cellular chemokine receptor (CCR5) antagonists, fusion inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors.

				"body": "Occupational HIV Postexposure Prophylaxis Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for health-care personnel who have occupational exposure to blood or other body fluids that may contain  human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV). [ 1,  2]  The HIV status of the exposure source patient should be determined, if possible, to guide the need for HIV PEP. PEP medication regimens should be started as soon as possible after occupational exposure to HIV, and they should be continued for a 4-week duration. PEP medication regimens should contain 3 (or more) antiretroviral drugs for all occupational exposures to HIV. An exposure that might place a health care provider at risk for HIV infection is defined as one of the following: Percutaneous injury (eg, a needlestick or cut with a sharp object) Contact of mucous membrane or nonintact skin (eg, exposed skin that is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis) In addition to blood and visibly bloody body fluids, the following fluids are considered potentially infectious: Semen and vaginal secretions Cerebrospinal fluid Synovial fluid Pleural fluid Peritoneal fluid Pericardial fluid Amniotic fluid Noninfectious exposures The following are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody: Feces Nasal secretions Saliva Sputum Sweat Tears Urine Vomitus Treatment recommendations HIV PEP should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within hours of exposure. Considerations include the following: Although animal studies demonstrate that PEP is likely to be less effective when started more than 72 hours after exposure, the interval after which no benefit is gained from PEP in humans is undefined. If PEP initiation is delayed, the likelihood increases that benefits might not outweigh the risks inherent in taking antiretroviral medications. Initiating therapy after a longer interval (eg, 1 week) might still be considered for exposures that represent an extremely high risk of transmission. Because 4 weeks of PEP appeared protective in in vitro, animal, and occupational studies, PEP should be administered for 4 weeks, if tolerated. Antiretroviral drug regimens The Public Health Service (PHS) no longer recommends that the severity of exposure be used to determine the number of drugs to be offered in an HIV PEP regimen. Currently, a regimen that contains 3 (or more) antiretroviral drugs is recommended routinely for all occupational HIV exposures. Examples of recommended PEP regimens include those that consist of a dual nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone plus an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI), or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Preferred regimen Raltegravir  plus  tenofovir/emtricitabine Raltegravir (400 mg) is given twice daily; enofovir/emtricitabine (300 mg/200 mg) is given once daily Alternative regimens Alternative regimens may combine 1 drug or drug pair from the INSTI, PI, or NNRTI classes with 1 pair of NRTIs listed below.

				"body": "According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , more than 1.2 million Americans are estimated to be living with HIV infection. More than 160,000 of those persons (14%) remain undiagnosed. With numerous advances in treatment and patient education, individuals with HIV are living longer lives. Are you familiar with the associated conditions to watch for and best treatment to initiate? Test your knowledge with our short quiz. 1 250 188 1 Many opportunistic infections and conditions are used to mark when HIV infection has progressed to AIDS. The general frequency of these infections and conditions varies from rare to common, but all are uncommon or mild in immunocompetent persons. Opportunistic infections and conditions include the following: Candidiasis of bronchi, trachea, or lungs Candidiasis, esophageal Cervical cancer, invasive Coccidioidomycosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary Cryptosporidiosis, chronic intestinal (duration > 1 mo) Cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen, or nodes) Cytomegalovirus retinitis (with vision loss) Encephalopathy, HIV-related Herpes simplex: chronic ulcer or ulcers (duration > 1 mo) or bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis Histoplasmosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal (duration > 1 mo) Kaposi sarcoma Lymphoma, Burkitt (or equivalent term) Lymphoma, immunoblastic (or equivalent term) Lymphoma, primary, of the brain Mycobacterium avium complex or Mycobacterium kansasii infection, disseminated or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, any site (pulmonary or extrapulmonary) Mycobacterium infection with other species or unidentified species, disseminated or extrapulmonary Pneumocystis pneumonia Pneumonia, recurrent Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Salmonella septicemia, recurrent Toxoplasmosis of the brain Wasting syndrome due to HIV infection Sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia, may be found in people with HIV who acquired their HIV infection via sexual transmission or who are not practicing safe sex, but are not considered opportunistic infections. For more on the pathophysiology of HIV and its relationship to opportunistic conditions, read here . 2 250 188 1 Secondary testing that may be performed to assist with diagnosis or staging includes the following: Viral culture Lymph node biopsy Proviral DNA PCR Genotyping of viral DNA/RNA Proviral DNA PCR is usually performed only in newborns because conventional serologic testing is useless in these patients (maternal antibodies may persist for 9 mo or longer). Two or more negative results separated by at least one month is considered a negative result. In June 2014, the CDC issued new recommendations for HIV testing in laboratories that are aimed at reducing the time needed to diagnose HIV infection by as much as 3-4 weeks over previous testing approaches. The new testing algorithm is performed as follows: Diagnosis starts with a fourth-generation test that detects HIV in the blood earlier than previous-generation tests can; in addition to HIV antibody testing, it identifies the viral protein HIV-1 p24 antigen, which appears in the blood before antibodies do. If this test is positive, an immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies should be performed; results from such assays can be obtained faster than they can from the Western blot test. In patients with positive results on the initial antigen test but with negative or indeterminate results on the antibody differentiation assay, HIV-1 nucleic acid testing should be performed to determine whether infection is present. A high-sensitivity ELISA should be used for initial screening. Most ELISAs can be used to detect HIV-1 types M, N, and O and HIV-2. A positive ELISA result should be followed with confirmatory testing in the form of one or more Western blot assays or similar specific assay. Specific diagnostic criteria vary by test. Results are typically reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate. The CD4 T-cell count is a reliable indicator of the current risk of acquiring opportunistic infections. CD4 counts vary, and serial counts are generally a better measure of any significant changes. Viral load in peripheral blood is used as a surrogate marker of viral replication rate. This is a surrogate because most of the viral replication occurs in the lymph nodes rather than in the peripheral blood. For more on the work-up of HIV, read here . 3 250 188 1 Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (a normally harmless commensal organism) is most important because this causes a common, preventable, serious infection. In patients with CD4 counts less than 200/μL, prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been shown to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia. For more on prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, read here . 4 250 188 1 Current guidelines recommend 5 regimens in ART-naive patients. Four are integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens, and one is a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-based regimen. The preferred regiments have evidence ratings of AI (ie, strong recommendation with data from randomized, controlled trials). INSTI-based regimens Dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC)* - only for patients who are HLA-B*5701 negative Dolutegravir (DTG) + tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)* Elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (Stribild; fixed dose product that contains EVG/c/TDF/FTC) - Only for patients with pre-ART creatinine clearance >70 mL/min Raltegravir (RAL) + tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)* PI/r-based regimen Darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) + tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)* * - Lamivudine (3TC) may be substituted for emtricitabine (FTC) or vice versa For more about the treatment of HIV, read here . 5 250 188 1 Guidelines from the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommend performing the following tests every 3 months in patients on antiretroviral therapy: Basic chemistry profile Liver function studies CBC with differential The basic chemistry studies should include serum sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose (preferably fasting), plus an estimate of creatinine clearance. Fasting glucose measurement is repeated every 3-6 months if abnormal at the last measurement, or every 6 months if normal at the last measurement. A fasting lipid profile is measured every 6 months if abnormal at the last measurement, or every 12 months if normal at the last measurement. In a clinically stable patient on an antiretroviral regimen whose viral load is suppressed and whose CD4+ T-cell count is well above the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, 2011 DHHS guidelines recommend that the CD4+ T-cell count may be monitored every 6-12 months (instead of every 3-6 months), unless there are changes in the patient's clinical status, such as new HIV-associated clinical symptoms or initiation of treatment with interferon, corticosteroids, or antineoplastic agents.

				"body": "Editor's Note : The Case Challenge series includes difficult-to-diagnose conditions, some of which are not frequently encountered by most clinicians but are nonetheless important to accurately recognize. Test your diagnostic and treatment skills using the following patient scenario and corresponding questions. If you have a case that you would like to suggest for a future Case Challenge, please contact us . Background A 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension , Parkinson disease , osteoporosis , and trigeminal neuralgia was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of fever, rash, and skin pain. Her widespread skin eruption started 3 days ago on her chest and spread centrifugally. She also reported a dull headache and that her eyes felt \"sore and scratchy.\" Her medications included hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), two extended-release capsules (carbidopa [23.75 mg] and levodopa [95 mg]) three times daily, and vitamin D (800 IU daily). She had been started on carbamazepine (100 mg twice daily) for her trigeminal neuralgia 6 weeks ago; this had recently been increased to 200 mg twice daily. Physical Examination and Workup Physical examination revealed an anxious and uncomfortable woman with a widespread eruption (Figures 1-3). Erythematous macules on the face, back, chest, and arms blanched with diascopy; sporadic lesions on the lower legs did not blanch entirely but were purpuric. No annular lesions were identified. Figure 1 . Figure 1. Figure 2 . Figure 2. Figure 3 . Figure 3. The patient's temperature was 102.2°F. Cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy were noted. Her laboratory studies were remarkable for atypical lymphocytosis and an elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 1375 U/L (reference range, 0-41 U/L). Her white blood cell count was > 12,000 cells/µL, and her absolute eosinophil count was > 900 eosinophils per µL of blood. Acute and chronic hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A , hepatitis B , and hepatitis C . Electrocardiography and echocardiography did not reveal any abnormalities. Figure 4 . Figure 4. Figure 5 . Figure 5. A biopsy was performed and revealed necrotic keratinocytes within the epidermis and a patchy perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate. Occasional eosinophils were noted (Figures 4 and 5). 1 Discussion Drug eruptions can present in many ways, and drugs can trigger psoriasis , leukocytoclastic vasculitis , and urticaria . Symptoms of \"skin pain\" and \"scratchy eyes\" associated with fever and lymphadenopathy should raise concern for a severe drug reaction. The elevated ALT level, presence of atypical lymphocytosis, elevated eosinophil count on peripheral blood analysis, and skin biopsy findings all support a diagnosis of a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which is also known as \"drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome\". [1-3] The timing of the eruption 6 weeks after starting use of carbamazepine in this patient is typical. [1] The onset of DRESS is often several weeks after a new medication is started, and the interval is often longer than that for other drug reactions encountered in clinical practice. DRESS is a serious and potentially life-threatening drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction characterized by skin lesions, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, and internal organ involvement (lung, liver, and kidney). [1-3] Most deaths are related to liver failure, but cardiac necrosis and renal failure can occur. The eruption usually begins 2-8 weeks after drug exposure. Certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes are particularly associated with DRESS. [1,4] Individuals of Han Chinese ancestry and those who have HLA-B*5801 may develop a severe drug reaction after initiation of allopurinol treatment, with some individuals progressing to DRESS. [4] Carbamazepine, allopurinol, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, sulfasalazine, phenytoin, vancomycin, and abacavir are common causes, in descending order of frequency, respectively. [1] Many other agents (eg, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) can also cause this reaction pattern; thus, carefully reviewing all medications is important. Reactivation of human herpesvirus 6 infection is associated with DRESS. [1] Whether the drug reaction triggers viral reactivation or whether viral reactivation somehow triggers a cross-reaction and tissue damage via CD8+ lymphocytes is uncertain. Biopsy reveals spongiosis, acanthosis, and an infiltrate with a variable amount of eosinophils, as well as dermal edema. The eruption usually begins in a morbilliform pattern and then becomes confluent. When facial edema, indurated skin lesions, scaling, and purpura are noted, DRESS must be suspected. Acute and eruptive psoriasis is typically associated with pustular lesions. Biopsy of psoriasis should reveal spongiform pustules. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is associated with purpuric lesions, and biopsy reveals damage of blood vessel walls not encountered in typical lesions of DRESS. Elderly individuals may have some purpuric lesions in dependent areas, such as the lower legs; however, this should not prompt a reflexive diagnosis of vasculitis . Urticaria is associated with transient wheals and not the fixed and widespread macular and papular eruption, as is seen in this patient. The workup should include serum chemistries; analysis of peripheral blood; and possibly a skin biopsy, which can exclude other dermatoses, such as psoriasis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and urticaria. Peripheral eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes on peripheral smear, or an elevated absolute lymphocyte count of greater than 4500 cells/µL are often found in DRESS. [1] Serum ALT levels are often twice the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase levels are often 1.5 times greater than the upper limit of normal. Proteinuria and abnormal urinalysis are also often associated with DRESS. According to Bocquet and colleagues, [5] diagnosis requires the following: [1] Drug rash Hematologic abnormalities: eosinophilia (> 1500 cells/µL), presence of atypical lymphocytes Systemic involvement: swollen lymph nodes (> 2 cm in diameter), hepatitis (aminotransferase elevation of at least twice the normal values), interstitial nephritis, pneumonitis, or carditis Newer criteria (eg, SCAR-J) have been proposed but have not yet been universally accepted. Much more research is needed in terms of how to best identify and classify cases. Skin lesions may have various different presentations that include a morbilliform eruption, exfoliative erythroderma, urticarial morbilliform presentation, or erythema multiforme-like lesions. [6] The erythema multiforme-like presentation of DRESS seems to be associated with more severe hepatic involvement. Treatment of DRESS involves withdrawing the offending drug. Skin lesions are often treated with high-potency topical corticosteroids. When severe organ involvement is identified, moderate- to high-dose systemic corticosteroids may be considered and are often prescribed, with a taper over many months. One report suggests that a 7-day course of cyclosporine may be helpful in treating DRESS. [7] Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this approach. In this patient, carbamazepine was discontinued at the time of consultation. Because of the marked elevation in the patient's liver enzyme values, she was placed on prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). She was also given a high-potency corticosteroid cream to apply to her skin lesions three times daily for 1 week. The patient's liver function normalized over the next 2-3 weeks, and her skin eruption resolved, as did her lymphadenopathy. She declined further treatment of her trigeminal neuralgia . 2 ",

				"body": "Overview The number of cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among young adolescents has been increasing over the years. Adolescents and young adults acquire HIV through high-risk behaviors. Many of them are recently infected or unaware of their HIV infection status. [ 1]  Early intervention, including prevention strategies, counseling, and HIV testing, plays a key role in treating adolescents and young adults. [ 2]  Antiretroviral Therapy Considerations For postpubertal adolescents, antiretroviral treatment guidelines for adults may be used; postpubertal youth who were perinatally infected may also use the adult antiretroviral treatment guidelines. [ 1]  Puberty has a direct effect on how a drug is metabolized and on the drugs' pharmacokinetic properties; therefore, dosage of medications for HIV infection should be based on the Tanner staging of puberty and not just on age alone. [ 3,  4]  Adolescents in early puberty (ie, Tanner stages I and II) should be on pediatric dosing schedules, whereas those in late puberty (ie, Tanner stage V) should follow adult dosing schedules. [ 1]  Adolescents who are undergoing their growth-spurt period (ie, Tanner stage III in females and Tanner stage IV in males) should follow the adult dosing guidelines. Puberty may be delayed in children who were perinatally infected with HIV, adding to discrepancies between Tanner stage-based dosing and age-based dosing. [ 5]  Dosing of antiretroviral medications for adolescents can be unpredictable and is dependent on multiple factors, including body mass and composition and chronologic age. [ 1]  The possibility of pregnancy should be discussed with all adolescent females; efavirenz should be avoided in women who plan to become pregnant, owing to teratogenic effects in the first trimester; potential interactions between antiretroviral drugs and hormonal contraception must be considered; Guidelines for Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV Infected Adults and Adolescents Tables 15a, b, and d provide further information. [ 1]  Adolescents are at risk of transmitted drug resistance, and baseline genotype data should guide antiretroviral selection.

				"body": "Overview Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has evolved from a disease that was predictably fatal to a chronic disease that can be effectively managed with contemporary  antiretroviral therapy  (ART) regimens. As a result of improved HIV care, the life expectancy in persons with HIV infection is similar to that in the general population. [ 1,  2]  HIV treatment guidelines now recommend ART in all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 cell count. [ 3]  Diagnosis of HIV infection soon after infection and early initiation of ART are highly important, as both have been associated with improved CD4 count gains during ART, a reduced risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) development, reduced T-cell activation, and greater vaccine responsiveness. [ 4,  5]  Primary care providers (PCPs) are experiencing new challenges and opportunities in the current era of  HIV infection . Understanding HIV risk factors and groups at highest risk is important, as targeted testing by PCPs plays an important role in diagnosing new HIV cases and preventing transmission to others. In 2011, an estimated 49,273 new HIV infections occurred in the United States. [ 6]  Most (65%) of these occurred in gay and bisexual men. Black/African American men and women were also strongly affected and were estimated to have an HIV incidence rate that was nearly 10 times higher than the incidence rate among whites. [ 6]  In addition to being on the front line for both HIV diagnosis and prevention, PCPs are increasingly involved in the co-management of HIV-infected patients with an HIV specialist. [ 7]  PCPs provide expertise in preventive care and management of chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and renal disease, which have become increasingly important for aging individuals with HIV infection. Components of HIV Care Caring for patients with HIV is challenging, and PCPs need to be mindful of special issues that encompass this population, like medical, psychological, and social challenges involved, along with the stigma associated with the disease. The most important aspect of patient care is education, which should include empowering patients with basic knowledge about HIV infection, methods of transmission, progression, prognosis, and prevention. A multidisciplinary approach that uses the special skills of nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, and case managers is desirable. [ 8,  9]  Presenting Signs and Symptoms HIV infection manifests in 3 main ways: An acute viral illness seen in the initial weeks of infection Immunologically mediated processes related to host responses to chronic viral infection Opportunistic diseases Acute Retroviral Syndrome Acute retroviral syndrome was first described in 1985 by Cooper and colleagues as an acute mononucleosislike syndrome. [ 10]  The incidence is not precisely known. A prospective study of homosexual men showed a 55% incidence in 22 subjects who became antibody-positive compared with 21% in 44 nonconverting control subjects. [ 11]  The onset of illness is between 2 and 6 weeks after viral transmission and is believed to correlate with peak viremia, often in excess of 1 million viral copies/mL. Symptoms and associated frequency are as follows: Fever: 96% Lymphadenopathy: 74% Pharyngitis : 70% Rash: 70% Myalgia or arthralgia: 54% Diarrhea: 32% Headache: 32% Nausea and vomiting: 27% Hepatosplenomegaly: 14% Weight loss: 13% Thrush: 12% Neurologic symptoms: 12% Oral or genital ulcers: 5%-20% [ 3]  Chronic Viral Infection In some cases, HIV infection is initially diagnosed when the patient presents with an AIDS-defining illness. These include the following: [ 12]  Bacterial infections, multiple or recurrent Candidiasis Cervical cancer , invasive Coccidioidomycosis , disseminated or extrapulmonary Cryptococcosis , extrapulmonary Cryptosporidiosis , chronic intestinal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease Encephalopathy, HIV related Herpes simplex  virus (HSV) - Chronic ulcers or bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis Histoplasmosis , disseminated or extrapulmonary Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal Kaposi sarcoma Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia complex Lymphoma - Burkitt  (or equivalent term), immunoblastic (or equivalent term), or primary Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC) or  Mycobacterium kansasii,  disseminated or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis  of any site, pulmonary, disseminated, or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium , other species or unidentified species, disseminated or extrapulmonary Pneumocystis  jiroveci  pneumonia (PJP) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Salmonella  septicemia, recurrent Toxoplasmosis of the brain Wasting syndrome attributed to HIV History and Physical Examination A detailed review of symptoms and a complete physical examination should be performed. [ 9]  Specific information to gather should include the date of the first positive HIV test, as well as the date of the most recent HIV care visit. The most important laboratory information for the PCP is the documentation of the patient’s most recent CD4 count and HIV viral load, as these serve as predictors of possible opportunistic infections upon presentation, or for which prophylaxis is needed. Other information to gather includes medication history, including antiretrovirals (ARVs) and immunization status (reviewed below), and sexual history, including previous sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Health-related behaviors such as tobacco abuse, alcohol use, drug use, and exercise and diet should be detailed and counseled appropriately. Laboratory Evaluation and Other Studies According to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) HIV treatment guidelines [ 3]  and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for primary care of HIV infection, [ 9]  the laboratory tests listed below are useful in monitoring and maintaining the health of patients with HIV infection. CD4 count This is important for HIV staging and prognosis. It helps guide initiation of ART and indicates risk of opportunistic infections and guides initiation of prophylaxis. DHHS guidelines [ 3]  recommend checking the CD4 count upon entry into care and repeating every 3-6 months in patients who have not initiated ART. In patients on ART, CD4 count monitoring should also be performed every 3-6 months during the first 2 years of ART or if viremia develops while the patient is on ART or if the CD4 count is below 300 cells/µL. After 2 years on ART with consistently suppressed viral load, the CD4 count can be tested every 12 months in those with a CD4 count between 300 and 500 cells/µL; CD4 count monitoring is optional in those with CD4 count over 500 cells/µL. HIV viral load This is used to monitor efficacy of ART. Viral load has a high sensitivity in the setting of acute HIV infection when antibody results may still be negative. The goal of ART is to suppress virus to undetectable levels, usually less than 20 or 50 copies/mL. DHHS guidelines [ 3]  recommend evaluating viral load upon entry into care and upon ART initiation or modification. In patients on ART, the viral load typically is measured every 3-4 months. However, in adherent patients with consistently suppressed viral load and stable immunologic status for more than 2 years, monitoring can be extended to every 6 months. Complete blood cell count Perform a complete blood cell (CBC) count upon entry into care and monitor every 3-6 months and upon ART initiation or modification. Complete metabolic profile Perform a complete metabolic profile upon entry into care and monitor every 3-6 months and upon ART initiation or modification. Urine analysis Perform a  urine analysis  upon entry into care and at ART initiation or modification and monitor every 12 months (or every 6 months in patients on tenofovir). More frequent monitoring may be indicated in patients with evidence of kidney disease. Lipid profile Perform a  lipid profile  upon entry into care, at ART initiation or modification, and every 6-12 months if the prior measurement was abnormal or normal, respectively. Glucose or glycated hemoglobin A1C Perform  glucose  (preferably fasting) or glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) upon entry into care, upon ART initiation or modification, and every 6-12 months if the prior measurement was abnormal or normal, respectively. Hepatitis A virus antibody If a hepatitis A virus (HAV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody test is negative, offer the patient vaccination (see section below). Hepatitis B virus infection status The patient’s hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status should be tested upon entry to care, including measurement of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), and antibody to hepatitis B total core antigen (anti-HBc or HBcAb). Those who are susceptible to infection should be vaccinated against HBV (see section below). Hepatitis C virus antibody Testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody should be performed upon entry to care and annually thereafter in those at risk. If positive, confirm result with HCV RNA. [ 13]  Toxoplasma gondii IgG If  T gondii  IgG results are negative, repeat if the patient becomes symptomatic or when the CD4 count is below 100 cells/µL. If the result is positive, initiate prophylaxis when the CD4 count is below 100 cells/µL. Tuberculosis screening Test for tuberculosis (TB) upon entry into care via either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Patients with positive test results should be treated for latent  M tuberculosis  infection after acute TB has been excluded. Patients who are close contacts of persons with infectious TB should be treated for latent  M tuberculosis  infection regardless of their TST results, age, or prior courses of TB treatment after the diagnosis of active TB has been excluded. Chest radiography Baseline chest radiographs should be obtained in all patients with a positive TST result to rule out active disease. Papanicolaou testing Cervical cancer screening in women: If a cervical  Papanicolaou test  yields normal findings, repeat after 6 months and then annually thereafter. If the findings are abnormal, further evaluation should be performed as indicated. Anal cancer screening: HIV-infected men and women with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are at increased risk for anal dysplasia and cancer, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM). Anal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer in patients with HIV infection or AIDS. [ 14,  14]  Anal cytologic screening (anal Papanicolaou test) is recommended in MSM, women with a history of receptive anal intercourse or abnormal cervical Papanicolaou test results, and all HIV-infected persons with genital warts. [ 9]  Anal cytology is a reasonable predictor of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), but there is poor correlation between cytology and histologic grade. [ 14]  Unfortunately, no randomized controlled trials have documented the value of AIN screening to date. Thus, the recommendation to perform anal Papanicolaou tests relies mostly on the histologic similarity between the cervix and the anus and the significant benefits of cervical cytology screening in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. Serum testosterone HIV-infected men are at risk for  hypogonadism . In male patients who experience fatigue, weight loss, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction or depression or who have evidence of reduced bone mineral density, consider obtaining morning serum total  testosterone  measurements. Syphilis screening Perform syphilis screening upon entry into care and at least annually in sexually active HIV-infected persons and frequent screening (every 3-6 months) in those considered high risk. A lumbar puncture should always be performed in patients with a reactive syphilis serology who have neurologic or ocular symptoms or signs (irrespective of past syphilis treatment) and in those who experience serologic treatment failure. Screening for STIs All women should be screened for  trichomoniasis , and women aged 25 years or younger should be screened for chlamydial infection. Men and women should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia infection at initial presentation and then annually if at risk for infection. Retesting in 3 months is indicated in men and women found to be positive for gonorrhea and chlamydial infections and women found to be positive for trichomoniasis on initial screening owing to high reinfection rates. STIs should be screened for periodically thereafter, depending on the population, reported behaviors, the presence of other STIs the patient or his/her partner(s), and the prevalence of STIs in the community. Herpes viruses Patients at lower risk of CMV infection should be tested for latent CMV infection with an anti-CMV IgG test upon initiation of care. Patients who do not have evidence of immunity to varicella should receive postexposure prophylaxis with VariZIG as soon as possible (but within 96 hours) after exposure to a person with varicella or shingles. Varicella primary vaccination may be considered in HIV-infected, VZV-seronegative persons aged 18 years with CD4 cell counts at or above 200 cells/µL. [ 15]  Immunizations Minimizing the risk of vaccine-preventable illnesses is an important component of primary care in HIV-infected individuals. Immunization recommendations in the setting of HIV infection are summarized below. Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type B vaccine Administer to asplenic patients and those with history of recurrent  Haemophilus  infections. Hepatitis A vaccine Administer to susceptible MSM, as well as others with indications for hepatitis A virus vaccine. Revaccinate in 6-12 months for Havrix or 6-18 months for Vaqta. Vaccine is also available in  combination  with hepatitis B vaccine as Twinrix, administered as 3 or 4 doses. Serologic response should be checked 1 month after completion of series, and nonresponders should be revaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine Administer to patients without evidence of past or present hepatitis B infection. Engerix-B or Recombivax HB is given at 0, 1, and 6 months. Vaccine is also available in combination with hepatitis A vaccine as Twinrix administered as 3 or 4 doses. Anti-HBV surface Ab titers should be checked 1 month after completion of vaccine series; if titer is 10 IU/mL or less, then revaccinate. Higher-dose booster or series may be considered in nonresponders. Human papillomavirus vaccine The quadrivalent HPV vaccination should be given to all HIV-infected males and females in a 3-dose series at age 11 or 12 years and in those aged 13-26 years if not previously vaccinated. Inﬂuenza vaccine This is administered yearly. Inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended; do not use live attenuated intranasal vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccine All patients with CD4 count above 200 cells/µL should receive a dose of PCV13 (Prevnar 13), followed by a dose of PPV23 (Pneumovax) at least 8 weeks later. If previously vaccinated with PPV23, give PCV13 at least 1 year after PPV23. A second PPV23 dose is recommended 5 years after the first PPV23 dose. Polio vaccine Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is contraindicated. Inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) should be given only if indicated. Administer 3 doses over 6-12 months for primary immunization. Tetanus toxoid Indications are same as for patients without HIV infection. Dose is  Td , 0.5 mL IM;  Tdap , 0.5-0.75 mL IM as per package insert. Substitute 1-time dose of Tdap vaccine at time of next booster, then Td every 10 years. Precautions should be observed with pregnancy. Td may be administered during second or third trimester or defer Td during pregnancy and administer Tdap postpartum. Measles, mumps, and rubella  (MMR) Live vaccine is contraindicated for use in patients with severe immunosuppression (CD4 count < 200 cells/µL). Administer to all nonimmune persons with CD4 counts of 200 cells/µL or more. Varicella zoster vaccine  (VZV) Live vaccine is contraindicated in patients with severe immunosuppression (CD4 count < 200 cells/µL). Consider for HIV-infected, VZV-seronegative persons with CD4 counts of 200 cells/µL or more. If vaccination results in infection with attenuated virus, treat with  acyclovir . Susceptible household contacts of susceptible HIV-infected individuals should be vaccinated. Avoid exposure to VZV. If someone without immunity to VZV is exposed to VZV, administer  varicella-zoster immune globulin  (VZIG) as soon as possible (but within 96 hours). Meningococcal conjugate vaccine ACIP recommends routine immunization with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (serogroups A, C, W, and Y; Menactra or Menveo) for persons aged 2 months or older with HIV infection. HIV-infected children younger than 2 years should receive the vaccine in accordance with the age-appropriate, licensed, multidose schedule (ie, Menveo at age 2, 4, 6, and 12 months). Persons aged 2 years or more with HIV infection who have not been previously vaccinated should receive a 2-dose primary series of MenACWY conjugate vaccine (Menactra or Menveo). Persons aged 2 years or older with HIV infection who have been previously vaccinated with 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a booster dose at the earliest opportunity, provided at least 8 weeks have elapsed since the previous dose, and then continue to receive boosters at the appropriate interval throughout life. [ 16]  System-Specific Infections The system-specific infections listed below are of concern when treating patients with HIV. Central nervous system A common symptom is headache. Some infectious causes include but are not limited to cryptococcal meningitis, neurosyphilis, tuberculous meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, toxoplasmic encephalitis, CMV meningoencephalitis, other encephalitis, other meningitis (bacterial, tuberculous, fungal, viral), coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis. Eyes Infections that can affect the eye include HSV, herpes zoster virus (HZV), syphilis, CMV retinitis (CD4 count < 100/µL),  Toxoplasma  retinochoroiditis, and cryptococcal chorioretinitis. Ears Unilateral and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss may be caused by HIV infection involving CNS and syphilis, among others. Nose and sinus Sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, nasal lesions, and nasal obstruction are common. Oral cavity Most common is oral candidiasis (CD4 cell count < 200/µL). Other causes include angular cheilitis, oral hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi sarcoma, and HSV. Gastrointestinal Some common symptoms are dysphagia and odynophagia, infectious causes of which include candidal esophagitis, CMV, HSV, Kaposi sarcoma, MAC, and histoplasmosis. Another presenting symptom is nausea and vomiting, which is a common side effect of many ARVs but can sometimes be a sign of opportunistic infections. Diarrhea is also a common symptom. Noninfectious causes such as adverse effects of ARVs, specifically protease inhibitors (PIs), are common. Infectious causes of diarrhea (occurring at any CD4 count) include viruses such as Norwalk virus, viral hepatitis, herpes enteritis,  Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E coli  O157:H7,  Giardia lamblia, E histolytica,  and  C difficile.  Other infectious causes of chronic diarrhea (occurring at CD4 cell counts < 300 cells/µL) include microsporidia, cryptosporidia,  Isospora , MAC, and CMV (at CD4 counts < 50 cells/µL). Lymphatic system Causes of lymphadenopathy include HIV infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), mononucleosis, EBV, MAC, TB, CMV, secondary syphilis, toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, other fungal diseases, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) involving various infections, and others. Pulmonary Infections occurring at any CD4 count include TB and influenza, among others. Infections occurring at CD4 500 cells/µL or less include recurrent bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary  Mycobacterium  pneumonia (nontuberculous). Those occurring at CD4 200 cells/µL or less include PJP,  Cryptococcus neoformans  pneumonia or pneumonitis, and disseminated or extrapulmonary TB. At CD4 100 cells/µL or less, pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma and toxoplasma pneumonitis can occur. At CD4 50 cells/µL or less, disseminated histoplasmosis, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, CMV pneumonitis, disseminated MAC, disseminated  Mycobacterium  (nontuberculous),  Aspergillus  pneumonia, and  Candida  pneumonia can occur. Genitourinary Vaginitis is a common symptom. Infectious causes include bacterial vaginosis (BV), candidiasis, trichomoniasis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), urinary tract infection, condyloma, HSV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Dermatologic Rash is probably the most common symptom. During routine workup, possible drug-induced rash should be excluded. The 2 main ARVs that cause rash are nevirapine and abacavir. Nevirapine can cause a mild rash; moderate to severe rash with or without hepatitis requires discontinuation. Rash due to abacavir may occur in isolation or as part of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction. The risk of hypersensitivity is closely linked to HLA-B*5701. Therefore, before starting an abacavir-containing regimen, patients should be tested for HLA-B*5701. Managing Comorbidities The comorbidities listed below may require management. Abnormalities of body fat distribution These are a recognized complication of ART. Lipohypertrophy has been variably associated with PIs and with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Lipoatrophy is most commonly associated with NRTIs, specifically stavudine, didanosine, and zidovudine. Once body shape changes occur, they cannot be reliably reversed, and switching to an NRTI-sparing regimen can slowly improve limb fat in patients with lipoatrophy but does not help patients with lipohypertrophy. Dyslipidemia Treatment involves a multimodal approach, incorporating diet changes, exercise, lipid-modifying drug therapy, and, potentially, changes to ART. New lipid management guidelines were released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ 17]  in November 2013, which emphasize global risk assessment rather than treat-to-cholesterol targets. If pharmacologic intervention is indicated for LDL reduction, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the first-line treatment. Note that significant drug interactions occur between most statins and both PIs and NNRTIs. PIs increase serum levels of most statins and increase risk of side effects (eg, rhabdomyolysis). Of all statins, pravastatin is least affected. Atorvastatin, if used, should be started at a low dose and titrated upward. Lovastatin and simvastatin are contraindicated; rosuvastatin and fluvastatin have not been as well studied. Most NNRTIs decrease levels of statins and higher doses may be needed. The other classes of ARVs do not have recognized interactions with statins. For treating hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates are the first-line drug option. Other drugs such as niacin can worsen insulin resistance and cause hepatotoxicity; bile acid sequestrants should be avoided because they can interfere with the absorption of other drugs. Hyperglycemia Patients taking ARVs, especially certain PIs and NRTIs, have an increased risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. The incidence of newly onset hyperglycemia among HIV-infected patients on ART has been reported as about 5%, on average. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus equating to a HbA1C value of 6.5% is defined by the American Diabetes Association. [ 18]  However, a lower HbA1C threshold of 5.8% has also been suggested, as this cutoff has been associated with better sensitivity and specificity for patients on ART. [ 19]  Coronary heart disease risk The incidence is increased up to 2- to 3-fold in HIV-infected individuals. A number of studies suggest that inflammation and immune activation due to uncontrolled HIV infection likely contributes to atherosclerosis. Clinicians should ask patients about coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD risk equivalents, and CHD risk factors and address these appropriately. Renal disease This can occur either as a primary or as a secondary disease. Some known risk factors include CD4 count less than 200 cells/µL; HIV viremia, particularly RNA levels greater than 4,000 copies/mL; African-American race; family history of kidney disease; and use of nephrotoxins. Screening studies at initial HIV documentation should include urine analysis and serum creatinine. If abnormal values are detected, these should be evaluated further. Of note, selective drugs can cause acute or chronic kidney injury. These include tenofovir (can cause acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome), indinavir (acute interstitial nephritis [AIN] and crystalluria), atazanavir (AIN and nephrolithiasis), and abacavir (AIN). Special consideration regarding dosing of their ARVs should be given to patients who have chronic kidney disease or are undergoing hemodialysis. Osteopenia and osteoporosis HIV infection and use of ART, particularly regimens containing tenofovir, increase the risk of premature bone loss, thereby exacerbating the risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. [ 9,  3]  In addition, some evidence suggests that women with HIV infection develop premature physiologic menopause. [ 9]  Baseline bone densitometry (DXA) screening for osteoporosis is recommended in HIV-infected postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years or older. [ 9]  Other recommendations include counseling patients about risk factors of osteopenia and osteoporosis, such as cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use, and the importance of regular exercise and adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. [ 9]  Adverse Effects of ARVs and Drug-Drug Interactions Drug-drug interactions are a common concern. The issues involved in evaluating drug interactions are complex. This complexity is increased because ARVs, specifically PIs, NNRTIs, and the CCR5 antagonist, can cause or be affected by alterations in the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver. Details on these interactions are available via the topic  Common Drug Interactions with Protease Inhibitors  and in published guidelines. [ 3]  The physician's role is to educate patients that ARVs have a high potential for significant drug interactions. A complete medication list, including any herbal, nutritional, and dietary supplements, should be reviewed at every visit. ",

				"body": "Overview Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy should focus on the reduction of perinatal transmission and the treatment of maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. [ 1]  ART can reduce perinatal transmission by several mechanisms, including lowering maternal antepartum viral load and preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis of the infant. Therefore, for prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV, combined antepartum, intrapartum, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis is recommended. [ 1]  Combination drug regimens are considered the standard of care for treatment of HIV infection and for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. [ 2,  3]  Clinical Data The Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 076 (PACTG 076) clinical trial showed that the administration of zidovudine (AZT, ZDV) to a pregnant woman and her infant could reduce the risk of perinatal transmission by nearly 70%. [ 4]  Subsequent trials and observational studies have shown combination antiretroviral prophylaxis administered to the mother antenatally is associated with reduced perinatal transmission rates of less than 2%. [ 2,  3,  1]  Additional trials have also identified simple regimens that are effective in reducing perinatal transmission in resource-limited countries. From these study results, we can better understand the use of antiretroviral drugs in resource-limited and resource-rich countries. [ 5,  6]  These clinical trials have provided the following guiding principles: The probability of HIV transmission is directly correlated with the viral load, especially the viral load at the time of delivery Regardless of HIV viral load and CD4 count, all HIV-infected pregnant women should be offered ART to reduce perinatal transmission Elective cesarean delivery reduces the risk of perinatal transmission and should be offered at week 38 if the viral load is likely to exceed 1000 copies/mL at delivery; there is no benefit if the viral load is less than 1000 copies/mL or when the procedure is done after rupture of membranes  Combination ART is more effective than a single-drug regimen in reducing perinatal transmission Longer duration of antepartum antiretroviral prophylaxis is more effective than shorter duration Antiretroviral drugs reduce perinatal transmission by several methods, accounting for the recommendation for a combination antepartum, intrapartum, and infant ART  In women who are already receiving antiretroviral treatment, the regimen needs to be reviewed for its adequacy in controlling HIV, its teratogenic potential, its pharmacologic effects, and patient tolerance during pregnancy  In the absence of antepartum ART, intrapartum antiretroviral drugs should be administered in combination with infant antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission  In the United States, addition of single-dose intrapartum/newborn nevirapine (NVP) to the standard antepartum combination antiretroviral regimens used for prophylaxis or treatment in pregnant women is not recommended, because it does not provide additional efficacy in reducing transmission and may be associated with NVP resistance  Breastfeeding is not recommended in women with HIV infection in the United States [ 1]  Factors in Antiretroviral Therapy Selection Antiretroviral therapy should be selected based on specific factors, including the following:  Comorbidities Patient adherence and convenience of therapy Potential for adverse drug effects on the mother and drug interactions Results of genotypic resistance testing Pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy Potential teratogenic effects on the fetus and other adverse effects on the fetus or newborn (this refers primarily to efavirenz [EFV], which is potentially teratogenic in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy [ 1]  )  Recommendations for Treatment-Naive Patients HIV antiretroviral drug resistance testing should be performed prior to initiating antiretroviral prophylaxis or therapy and should be performed if the woman is receiving ART with virologic failure (viral load >500-1000 copies/mL).  If a woman with HIV infection presents late in pregnancy, ART should be initiated immediately, before availability of resistance testing.  If a woman requires immediate initiation of therapy for her own health, initiate treatment as soon as possible, including in the first trimester; delay until second trimester may be considered based on maternal CD4, GI tolerability, and potential fetal risk of first trimester exposure.  A backbone of dual nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or low-dose ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) is the preferred initial regimen in pregnancy.  Preferred Treatment Regimens Preferred regimens have demonstrated optimal efficacy and durability with acceptable toxicity and ease of use. No evidence of teratogenic effects on the fetus or established association with teratogenic or clinically significant adverse outcomes for the mother, fetus, or newborn are present. [ 1]  Two–non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone Regimens include the following: Zidovudine with lamivudine (300 mg ZDV/150 mg 3TC) PO BID (combination with most experience in pregnancy; can cause hematological toxicity)  or Tenofovir with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or lamivudine (3TC) once daily (use with caution in renal insufficiency)  or Abacavir with lamivudine (ABC/3TC) once daily (only if HLA-B5701–negative) Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ̶ based regimen After the first 8 weeks of pregnancy, efavirenz (EFV) alone is used. Although there are concerns of potential neural tube defects in women of childbearing age before pregnancy is detected, increasing data in pregnancy are reassuring. [ 7]  Protease inhibitor ̶ based regimens Regimens include the following: Lopinavir (LPV) 400 mg  plus  ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg PO BID if no lopinavir-associated resistance substitutions (pharmacokinetic study demonstrated 40% decrease in C12h during second and third trimester but not considered significant [ 8]  ); insufficient data for any dosage recommendations in the presence of any lopinavir-associated resistance substitution; once-daily LPV/RTV dosing is not recommended during pregnancy; oral solution should be avoided in pregnancy due to high alcohol content;  or Atazanavir  (ATV) is recommended to be combined with low-dose  ritonavir  (RTV) boosting (ATV/RTV): ATV 300 mg  plus  RTV 100 mg PO daily as a single daily dose; some experts increase ATV/RTV dose to 400/100 mg daily during second and third trimester; manufacturer recommends dose increase in pregnancy if combined with tenofovir or H2 blocker in treatment-experienced patients and with efavirenz in treatment-naive patients  Alternative Treatment Regimens Alternative regimens are designated as alternatives for initial therapy in pregnant women when clinical trial data in adults show efficacy but one or more of the following conditions apply: [ 1]  Limited experience in pregnancy Lack of data on teratogenic effects on the fetus Dosing, formulation, administration, or interaction issues for that drug or regimen Protease inhibitor ̶ based regimens These include the following: Darunavir (DRV) 800 mg combined with 100 mg RTV daily  or Saquinavir  (SQV) is recommended to be combined with low-dose RTV boosting (SQV/RTV): 1000 mg PO BID  plus  RTV 100 mg PO BID after baseline ECG for potential PR and QT prolongation [ 9]  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ̶ based regimen Nevirapine (NVP): The initial  NVP  dose is 200 mg (immediate-release formulation) PO daily for the first 14 days. The maintenance NVP dose is 200 mg PO BID  or  extended release 400 mg PO daily. Patients with mild to moderate rash during the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release NVP should not have their NVP dose increased until the rash resolves. NVP should not be initiated in patients with CD4 counts exceeding 250 cells/µL because of increased risk of hepatotoxicity in women with high CD4 counts.  Integrase inhibitors Raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg BID can be considered in selected circumstances such as GI intolerability to PI or drug-drug interactions.  Intrapartum Care Intrapartum AZT should be administered to pregnant HIV-infected women if the HIV viral load is 1000 or more copies/mL or unknown at time of delivery, irrespective of mode of delivery. [ 10]  AZT 2 mg/kg IV is administered over 1 hour, then continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg/h from onset of labor to delivery. Oral AZT, if part of the combination regimen, should be stopped while IV AZT is administered. IV AZT is not required if the patients is receiving combination therapy and the HIV viral load is consistently less than 1000 copies/mL near time of delivery and adherence is reliable.  Recommendations for Pregnant HIV-Infected Women Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy Women who are receiving ART for HIV infection should continue the same regimen during pregnancy in general if it is well tolerated and they have effective HIV virologic suppression.  Efavirenz should be avoided in women of childbearing age. Consideration can be given to continuing efavirenz if pregnancy occurs on an efavirenz-based regimen if it is well tolerated with virologic suppression, as risk of potential neural tube defect has already occurred by the time pregnancy is recognized. In addition, there may be risk of viral escape with regimen change. [ 11]  ",

				"body": "Editorial Note: The Case Challenge series includes difficult-to-diagnose conditions, some of which are not frequently encountered by most clinicians but are nonetheless important to accurately recognize. Test your diagnostic and treatment skills using the following patient scenario and corresponding questions. A 45-Year-Old Man With Progressive Shortness of Breath Background A 45-year-old man with a history of HIV infection presents to the emergency department with progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for the past month. He has a cough that is productive of white sputum and today awoke with a temperature of 101.0°F (38.3°C). The patient reports no chest pain, hemoptysis, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, or lower-extremity swelling. He developed thrush in the previous 1-2 weeks and has also developed anorexia, with a 20-lb weight loss, over the past 3 months. The remainder of his review of systems is negative. He does not report any recent travel or sick contacts. He has taken no medications recently and elected to stop his HIV therapy regimen 10 years ago because of the adverse effect of severe diarrhea. The patient does not smoke, consume alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He is sexually active with 1 partner and uses condoms inconsistently. The patient has no known drug allergies. Figure 1. Figure 2. On physical examination, the patient's temperature is 101.0°F (38.3°C) tympanic. His pulse rate is 136 beats/min, with a regular rhythm. His blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 30 breaths/min, with an oxygen saturation of 76% while breathing room air. In general, the patient is cachectic and dyspneic. He has dry mucous membranes, with removable white plaques throughout the oropharynx. The remaining head and neck examination is normal. Coarse bibasilar crackles are present on auscultation. His chest is nontender on palpation, is resonant to percussion, and expands symmetrically. Except for tachycardia, the cardiac examination is normal. The abdominal and neurologic examinations are unremarkable. The patient has no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema of the extremities. His skin is warm, dry, and free of lesions or rashes. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. Figure 1. Figure 2. An electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia. The patient's arterial blood gas is consistent with respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia . A chest x-ray shows diffuse, bilateral increased interstitial markings, and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest demonstrates diffuse ground-glass opacities without lymphadenopathy or pulmonary embolus (Figures 1 and 2). The white blood cell count is 5.2 × 10 3 /μL. The CD4 lymphocyte count is 38 cells/μL. The result on quantitative HIV-1 RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is 1,710,000 copies/mL. Routine blood and urine cultures are negative. An induced sputum specimen is sent for analysis. 1 Discussion The diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) was based on the patient's history, physical examination, chest x-ray, chest CTA (although not required for diagnosis), and microscopic examination. The patient's induced sputum sample showed rare mixed flora; as a result, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen was obtained. Direct fluorescent antibody testing of the BAL specimen demonstrated P jiroveci . Additional testing, including acid-fast bacilli staining of the sputum; Cryptococcus neoformans antigen testing and serologic testing fortoxoplasmosis and syphilis. Sputnum cultures for cytomegalovirus , fungal pathogens, Legionella pneumophila , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative thus, ruling out alternative diagnoses. Figure 1. Figure 2. P jiroveci , previously known as P carinii , has been reclassified from a protozoan to a fungal organism and is one of the most prevalent AIDS-defining infections. Although Pneumocystis species resemble protozoa morphologically, the cell wall composition and nucleotide sequences are more characteristic of fungi. [1] The incidence of PJP is 0.5% in HIV -infected individuals with a CD4 count of 201-350 cells/µL and 8% in those with a CD4 count < 200 cells/µL. [2] The Pulmonary Complications of HIV Infection Study Group, which included more than 1100 individuals, found that 95% of patients with P jiroveci , infections had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/µL. This study also showed that HIV transmission category, smoking history, and age did not predict the development of pneumonia. The risk of developing PJP in black patients was one third of that seen in white patients. [3] Several risk factors for the development of PJP in patients who are not infected with HIV have been identified, including malignancy, immunosuppression , and solid-organ transplantation. Immunomodulators (most commonly, corticosteroids) and monoclonal antibody therapy are also associated with P jiroveci infection. [4] Figure 1. Figure 2. P jiroveci cannot be sustained outside a host lung, and this limits research involving the organism. In addition, unique forms infect different animal species. P jiroveci is the official name for human Pneumocystis , and this organism cannot infect other animal species. Likewise, organisms found in other animals cannot infect humans. Although the transmission of P jiroveci is not well understood, current evidence supports human-to-human acquisition, probably via airborne particles. This route is favored over the previous suggestion that pneumonia develops from reservoirs of colonized P jiroveci acquired during childhood. Evidence supporting this includes the observation that the same strain of organism infects transplant patients in the same hospital. [1] Once inside a host lung, the haploid trophic form of P jiroveci is thought to adhere to type 1 alveolar cell membranes, then cluster to conjugate and progress as cysts. The cysts produce intracystic sporozoites, which are released and differentiate into trophozoites. One survival mechanism within the host lung may involve disabling phagocytic activity and reducing alveolar macrophage activation. [5] Studies have shown that HIV-infected patients with P jiroveci have fewer neutrophils and a higher organism burden than non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients. This observation may account for the difference in the clinical features of PJP observed in patients with AIDS as compared with those without AIDS. Although the host immune system limits and clears Pneumocystis infections, an exaggerated inflammatory response results in lung injury and alveolar damage, impaired gas exchange, and respiratory failure . Nearly all HIV-infected patients present with a gradual onset of fever, progressive dyspnea, and cough that is usually nonproductive. They may also experience chest pain, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. Seven percent of patients are asymptomatic. The physical examination findings include fever, tachypnea, and crackles or rhonchi on auscultation; however, approximately half of patients have normal chest examinations. In contrast to HIV-infected patients, individuals with compromised immune systems resulting from other causes present with acute fulminate respiratory failure that frequently requires mechanical ventilation . Other symptoms include fever and nonproductive cough, which may correlate with immunosuppressant titration or dosage. [4,5] A difference in patient mortality has also been observed. The mortality of patients with AIDS and acute PJP infection is 10%-20% and is significantly higher for those requiring mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate in non-HIV-infected patients with PJP approaches 30%-60%. [6] PJP can be difficult to diagnose initially. The first signs and symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle or atypical in those receiving prophylactic drugs. In addition, immunocompromised patients may be co-infected with multiple organisms. Because P jiroveci cannot be cultured, microscopic evaluation is required for definitive diagnosis. The first step in diagnosing PJP is obtaining sputum induced by the inhalation of hypertonic saline, which has a 55%-92% yield. The sensitivity may be lower in patients using aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis. A negative result should prompt the performance of BAL, a more invasive test with sensitivity ranging from 89% to 98%. Potential complications of BAL include fever and respiratory failure. Transbronchial biopsy is usually not indicated because of the high sensitivity of BAL and the potential complications of hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Similarly, transthoracic needle biopsy is highly sensitive, but should be avoided because of a 30% incidence of pneumothorax . Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical biopsies have sensitivities reported as 100%, but they are rarely used because of the expense and invasiveness of the procedure. If a patient is intubated, endotracheal aspirates yield a sensitivity of 92%, usually making BAL unnecessary. Sputum or bronchial aspirates may be stained for the trophic or cystic forms of P jiroveci . Immunofluorescence studies with monoclonal antibodies can detect trophic and cystic forms and may increase the sensitivity of induced sputum specimens. The diagnostic role of PCR is also being investigated. PCR may help differentiate colonization from infection as well as identify drug-resistant strains of P jiroveci . Another possible diagnostic test that has been investigated is measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels; although a normal serum level makes P jiroveci unlikely, an elevated level has low specificity. The appropriate initial imaging study for immunocompromised patients with pulmonary or constitutional symptoms is 2-view chest x-ray. Radiographically, PJP classically presents as bilateral perihilar interstitial infiltrates that become more extensive and may progress to consolidations over several days; however, multiple chest x-ray findings, including normal findings, have been described in HIV-positive patients with PJP. Chest x-ray findings resolve in 2-4 weeks with appropriate treatment. Parenchymal injury may result in persistently abnormal radiographic findings. Up to 10%-39% of patients may have a normal chest x-ray. Less common findings include parenchymal nodules, pneumatocele, focal consolidation, bronchiectasis , and pneumothorax. Spontaneous PJP-associated pneumothorax have higher mortality rates. Patients previously treated with aerosolized pentamidine may present with upper lobe infiltrates. High-resolution chest tomography (HRCT) may help with the diagnosis if the chest x-ray is negative and clinical suspicion remains high. The HRCT finding of ground-glass attenuation opacities is noted when exudate fills alveoli without obstruction of the underlying pulmonary architecture. [6] One study reported a sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 89% in the presence of patchy or nodular ground-glass densities on HRCT. [4] The differential diagnosis of ground-glass opacities includes pulmonary edema, drug toxicity, hypersensitivity pneumonitis , acute respiratory distress syndrome , lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma , and other opportunistic lung infections. Focal consolidation is a less common finding. Although HRCT does not establish the diagnosis, a negative study may exclude the diagnosis. Another highly sensitive imaging examination is gallium-67 citrate scanning, which demonstrates diffuse, intense uptake in patients with PJP. Low specificity, a 2-day delay in results, and expense limit the utility of this test. P jiroveci infection that occurs despite the use of appropriate prophylactic therapy may result in lower sensitivity and atypical imaging findings. [4,5] The treatment of choice for acute PJP infection is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 21 days. The recommended dose for mild or moderate disease is 320 mg of trimethoprim and 1600 mg of sulfamethoxazole every 8 hours. Severe disease requires parenteral therapy. For patients with sulfa drug allergies, alternative therapy includes parenteral pentamidine, atovaquone, dapsone-trimethoprim, or clindamycin-primaquine. Empiric treatment for PJP is discouraged in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because of concerns of the lower prevalence of PJP or atypical presentation in those receiving HAART or prophylactic antibiotic therapy and the potential concerns for drug toxicity. Adjunctive therapy with systemic corticosteroids has been shown to improve the clinical outcome and mortality rate in HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe symptoms from PJP without increasing the risk for other opportunistic infections. In particular, HIV-infected patients with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen < 70 mm Hg while breathing room air or an alveolar-arteriolar gradient > 35 have been shown to benefit from the addition of corticosteroids. The recommended prednisone regimen includes 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, 40 mg daily for the next 5 days, and 20 mg for the following 10 days. [7] Prophylaxis against PJP in HIV-infected patients begins when the CD4 count is < 200 cells/µL. Other indications include a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis or PJP. Prophylaxis is discontinued when the CD4 count rises above 200 cells/µL for 3 months, as may occur in response to HAART, and is reinstituted if the CD4 count decreases below the threshold. The prophylactic agent of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Alternatives include dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, and atovaquone. For non-HIV-infected patients, immunosuppressive therapy is an indication for prophylaxis, although a regimen has not been established. [8] The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be limited for several reasons. Patients with sulfa medication allergies may not tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Some studies have shown an association between failed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and treatment in patients with mutations of the dihydropteroate synthase ( DHPS ) gene, which encodes the folate biosynthesis enzyme inhibited by sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to other pharmaceuticals has also emerged in patients receiving prophylactic therapy. Strains of P jiroveci with mutations in cytochrome b, the target of atovaquone, have been observed. Multiple studies have addressed concerns about the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole by patients treated with methotrexate and failed to show the development of severe myelosuppression with prophylaxis. [5] However, treatment guidelines recommend folate supplementation or leucovorin with complete blood count and monitoring of liver function tests. The patient was admitted and treated with parenteral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a prednisone taper, and supplemental oxygen. The patient was transitioned to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and eventually switched to atovaquone for prophylaxis. He received nystatin rinses and fluconazole for thrush . Since his discharge, a new primary care physician and an infectious disease physician have guided the patient's follow-up care, including the initiation of lamivudine, ritonavir, atazanavir, and abacavir for antiretroviral therapy. 2 ",

Test your diagnostic and treatment skills using the following patient scenario and corresponding questions. If you have a case that you would like to suggest for a future Case Challenge, please contact us . Background A 42-year-old comatose man is brought to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance. He had recently been hospitalized for decompensated hepatitis C virus liver cirrhosis at another hospital, from which he left against medical advice. In the hours before admission to the ED, the patient experienced two witnessed episodes of loss of consciousness associated with urinary incontinence and myoclonic jerks. The patient's prescribed medications include abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine daily for HIV infection . He also takes furosemide (50 mg), potassium canrenoate (an aldosterone antagonist), lorazepam, and methadone (90 mg); the latter is for the management of heroin addiction . Physical Examination and Workup Upon physical examination, the patient is lethargic, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score is 6 (eye opening response, 1; verbal response, 1; motor response, 4). His pupils are normal in size and bilaterally reactive to light. He has a temperature of 96.8°F (36.5°C), a blood pressure of 90/54 mm Hg, and a pulse rate of 86 beats/min. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min, and he has an oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing room air. Figure 1 . Figure 1. Figure 2 . Figure 2. Upon auscultation, the lung fields are clear bilaterally, and normal heart sounds are heard. His peripheral pulses are palpable; however, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema is present. The abdomen is distended, tense, and with ascites. His sclerae are noted to be icteric. Laboratory tests are ordered, with pertinent findings that include a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL (111 g/L) and a platelet count of 24 × 10 3 /μL (24 × 10 9 /L). A chemistry panel reveals the following: Sodium level: 134 mEq/L (134 mmol/L) Potassium level: 3.2 mEq/L (3.2 mmol/L) Creatinine level: 0.6 mg/dL (53.04 µmol/L) Glucose level: 148 mg/dL (8.21 mmol/L) Bilirubin level: 4.7 mg/dL (80.37 µmol/L) Magnesium level: 1.3 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L; reference range, 1.5-2.5 mg/dL) Ammonium level: 153.3 µg/dL (90 μmol/L; reference range, 11-79 µg/dL) Ionized calcium level: 3.96 mg/dL (0.99 mmol/L; reference range 4.6-5.6 mg/dL) His troponin level is 0.07 ng/mL (0.07 μg/L; reference value is <0.12 ng/mL). Serum alcohol testing results are negative, and a urine toxicology screen is negative for cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates (note that methadone usage may not cause a positive opiate result). A CT scan of the brain is negative for acute abnormalities. The patient is initially thought to have had a seizure and is cautiously given benzodiazepines to prevent a recurrence. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is then performed (Figure 1). Soon afterwards, an abnormal tracing is seen on the cardiac monitor (Figure 2), and the patient becomes pulseless and apneic and requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 1 Discussion The cardiac rhythm strip (Figure 2) demonstrated torsade de pointes (French for \"twisting of the points\"), otherwise known as simply \"torsades\" or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Figure 1 . Figure 1. Figure 2 . Figure 2. The initial ECG (Figure 1), which was obtained before the development of the torsades, revealed a prolonged QT interval (544 msec), with a QT interval corrected for the heart rate (QTc) of 647 msec. Moreover, notched T waves were noted in leads II, III, aVF, and V1-V6. A prolonged QT interval is often noted incidentally on an ECG in an asymptomatic patient; however, in a patient who presents with palpitations, presyncope, syncope , or cardiac arrest, the presence of a prolonged QT interval should raise particular concern for torsade de pointes. QT prolongation can be either acquired or congenital. A thorough clinical history-taking and knowledge of the patient's current medications is very important for this differentiation. Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder characterized by abnormal QT-interval prolongation on the ECG caused by cardiac myocyte ion channel gene mutations, with a propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients are typically young and may present with syncope or sudden death. [1,2] Acquired QT interval prolongation may be drug-induced, or it may be caused by certain electrolyte derangements, such as hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. Many drugs have been implicated, including class 1A antiarrhythmic drugs such as quinidine and procainamide and class III antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone and sotalol. Others drugs that have been implicated include antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin), pentamidine, serotonin receptor antagonists (ketanserin), diuretics (indapamide), certain fluoroquinolone antibiotics, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics (phenothiazines, haloperidol, mesoridazine, pimozide, thioridazine, ziprasidone), gastrointestinal motility enhancers (cisapride, domperidone), inotropes (amrinone, milrinone), toxins (organophosphates, arsenic), protease inhibitors, and methadone. [3-10] Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is directly linked to a modification in myocardial cell repolarization, which is mediated by the efflux of potassium ions. The shape of the action potential depends on the balance between sodium and calcium inflow and potassium outflow. Two subtypes of the delayed rectifier K+ current, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), are responsible for repolarization. The human ether-a-go-go related gene ( hERG ; also termed KCNH2 ) codes for a protein known as the Kv 11.1 potassium ion channel, which mediates the repolarizing potassium current IKr. Blockage of the hERG -encoded potassium channels has been implicated as a cause of drug-induced QT prolongation. A strong correlation is noted between IKr blockade and ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death. Drugs that block the IKr channel increase the QT interval and allow inward current, particularly calcium, to reactivate, leading to early after-depolarizations in cardiac tissue that may result in torsades. Other drugs implicated in QT prolongation have no effect on the potassium channels; therefore, additional cardiac mechanisms can play a significant role. [3-5,10] Some medications prolong the QT interval at specific doses, whereas others may act at any dose. Several agents are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) system, and drug-drug interactions and consequent QT prolongation can causes torsades . Drug interactions in this setting are primarily pharmacokinetic. When administering a drug that potentially prolongs the QT interval, numerous predisposing factors for torsades development must be considered, including advanced age, obesity, poor nutrition ( anorexia nervosa , starvation diets, alcoholism ), bradycardia (<50 beats/min), cerebrovascular disease ( intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage , stroke, intracranial trauma, thalamic hematoma), congenital long QT syndrome , heart failure (cardiomyopathy, dilated or hypertrophic ), hypoglycemia , hypothermia , hypothyroidism , myocardial ischemia or infarction , organophosphate exposure, pheochromocytoma , pituitary insufficiency, coadministration of other QT prolonging agents, and hypoxia. If a drug-drug interaction is suspected, the drug should be withdrawn. Ehret and colleagues [9] studied a population of active or former intravenous drug abusers and suggested that methadone (even at low doses), CYP3A4 inhibitors, and hepatic dysfunction contributed to prolongation of QT. Methadone delays cardiac repolarization by blocking the flow of potassium ions through the hERG channels, but no evidence suggests interaction between this drug and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. [4,5,7,9-11] Torsade de pointes is characterized by QRS complexes that vary in axis and amplitude over the isoelectric line (\"twisting around the points,\" as the name implies). Other associated characteristics include the presence of long and short beat-to-beat (RR) interval onset after an early premature ventricular contraction. A relationship between the degree of QT interval prolongation and the development of torsades is noted. The QT interval varies directly with heart rate, and a correction is required in order to compensate for heart rate. A commonly used correction (QTc) is the Bazett correction (QTc=QT/√RR), wherein QT is the longest QT interval measured on the ECG, and RR is an average RR interval. QT measurement should be made manually from a 12-lead ECG, and it is calculated from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave and averaged over three to five beats in a single lead. Prominent U waves should be included in the measurement if they merge into the T wave. It is advisable to assess QT during peak plasma concentration of any ingested QT-prolonging substances and to correct it for heart rate while looking for other warning signs, including the appearance of prominent U waves, extrasystoles, and U wave augmentation after extrasystole. Corrected QT is considered to be prolonged if it is beyond 440 msec for adult males, 460 msec for adult females, and 500 msec in the presence of ventricular depolarization abnormalities (ie, bundle branch blocks or intraventricular conduction delay greater than 120 msec). The uncorrected QT interval should also be considered, however, as a very long QT (>600 msec) after drug exposure is a marker of an increased risk for torsades. [2,4,10,12] The patient in this case was initially treated with 2 g of intravenous magnesium sulfate and 1 g of calcium chloride. Despite this, he developed recurrent torsade de pointes . He underwent repeated defibrillation followed by irregular rhythms, including premature atrial complexes and ventricular bigeminy. The recurrent episodes of torsade de pointes were then treated with an intravenous bolus of lidocaine followed by a 2-mg/min infusion. Normal sinus rhythm then returned, and the patient slowly improved and regained consciousness. In this case, the cause of the patient's QT prolongation was likely multifactorial and probably included the chronic use of methadone and electrolyte derangement. Slight hypomagnesemia , hypocalcemia , and hypokalemia were noted. These mild electrolyte abnormalities alone are not sufficient to result in torsade de pointes, as evidenced by the persistence of episodic torsade de pointes despite electrolyte replacement. Once the methadone was withdrawn, however, no further episodes of torsade de pointes occurred, and the QT interval normalized. Immediate treatment for patients who develop torsades can be categorized into pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Intravenous magnesium sulfate (2-g bolus followed by an infusion of 2-4 mg/min) is the initial therapy, regardless of the serum levels of magnesium. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and the torsades persists, or if ventricular fibrillation develops, immediate unsynchronized defibrillation is indicated. Serum potassium levels should be maintained in the high-normal range (4.5-5 mmol/L). Overdrive transvenous pacing shortens the QT interval and is highly effective in preventing recurrences, especially in the setting of bradycardia. Maintaining a heart rate greater than 70 beats/min protects against drug-induced torsades. [10] Isoproterenol is useful if temporary pacing is unavailable or while preparing for transvenous catheter insertion. It is contraindicated in patients with congenital LQTS and in ischemic heart disease. Additional treatments include discontinuation of any drug known to cause QT prolongation, correction of electrolyte disturbances, and monitoring the cardiac rhythm until the patient is considered out of risk. Beta-blockers can help prevent symptoms in most people with long QT syndrome, but they do not substantially shorten the QT interval. This class of drugs slows the heart rate and helps prevent tachyarrhythmia. Long-acting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol are usually used. The use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) is widely considered in patients at high risk for sudden death. [6,13] This case illustrates an incident of likely drug-induced torsade de pointes resulting from methadone usage in the setting of electrolyte abnormalities. The case highlights the need for an evaluation for potential cardiogenic causes of syncope in patients who present with an abnormal ECG. 2 ",

				"body": "Overview The challenges of managing HIV infection include difficulties with direct detection of the virus, a prolonged asymptomatic period of infection, and decisions regarding the initiation of therapy and regimen changes in response to antiretroviral drug resistance or intolerance. All of these rely on laboratory testing to guide the clinician. There are specific and unique laboratory techniques that are used with HIV infection that medical providers should be aware of, in terms of availability, utility, and limitations. Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of screening and confirmatory serologic tests. During therapy, it is crucial to monitor the response, both in terms of immune reconstitution and viral replication, as both have different implications for the patient and neither may be evidenced by any outward signs or symptoms. Treatment failures may be due to the development of drug resistance mutations in the virus; some mutations may result in resistance to multiple antiretroviral agents or even to entire classes of drugs. Special tests include resistance testing by genotypic or phenotypic tests, pre-treatment tests for HLA-B*5701 in the context of abacavir, and viral tropism testing in the case of maraviroc. The laboratory can assist with all of these issues, from diagnosis to drug-resistance testing. For other discussions on management of HIV infection, see  HIV Disease ,  Pediatric HIV Infection , and  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . Diagnosis A key feature of HIV infection is the prolonged clinical latency that occurs prior to significant immune deficiency. [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]  During this period (which can last several years from the time of initial infection), the individual may exhibit few or no symptoms but is still able to spread the infection to others and may be at risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections. Early detection is important for minimizing those risks. In general, detection of HIV infection is indirect, through the use of specific serologic tests for antibodies to HIV proteins. Because HIV is a lifelong infection, positive serology is diagnostic of current rather than cleared infection. Some direct methods do exist, but they have limitations and their role is limited to specific situations. One of the difficulties in diagnosing HIV is the so-called “window period” immediately after the acquisition of infection, during which serology may be negative. In studies of occupationally exposed health care workers, seroconversion typically occurs within 2 months of exposure; rarely, seroconversion takes longer than 6 months. [ 6]  This period typically lasts from 3 weeks to 3 months. Fortunately, non-serologic tests can be employed to cover this period. [ 5]  Serologic testing The primary diagnostic method is a combination of a sensitive screening assay for anti-HIV antibodies with a follow-up confirmatory test. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is a sensitive technique designed to detect antibodies to specific HIV proteins (eg, p24 capsid antigen, gp120 envelope glycoprotein). In older assays, HIV proteins were bound to a surface such as a 96-well plate, and antibody binding took place in the well. Secondary detection of the bound antibody, using anti-human antibodies linked to an enzyme, would result in a colorimetric change that could be measured (see the image below). Schematic of enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) technique. 1) viral antigen is bound to a solid... Schematic of enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) technique. 1) viral antigen is bound to a solid substrate. 2) Patient serum with specific antibodies is added and binds to the antigen. 3) After removal of excess antibody, a detection antibody is added, to confirm binding of patient antibodies.  More recently, less labor-intensive tests using solid-phase media similar to those in over-the-counter pregnancy test kits have resulted in a plethora of testing modalities. Rapid testing can currently be performed on whole blood, serum, urine, or saliva, depending on the test kit employed. [ 7,  8]  Several tests have been \"CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) waived\" by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning that no detailed training or laboratory validation is required to use these tests for clinical purposes. High sensitivity comes at the price of lower specificity, although most modern screening tests for HIV demonstrate both excellent sensitivity and specificity. There are several known causes of false-positive screening results for HIV, and because a diagnosis of HIV infection has important consequences, it is essential that all patients with positive or indeterminate screening results undergo secondary testing using a different test modality. Causes of false-positive HIV screening tests include the following: Epstein-Barr virus Pregnancy Receipt of immune globulin Hyperbilirubinemia Autoimmune disease Confirmatory testing of samples with positive or indeterminate screening results is traditionally performed using a Western blot or similar test. Specific responses to particular HIV proteins are detected by binding serum antibodies to viral proteins attached to a solid substrate. This can either be a true Western blot of proteins that have undergone electrophoresis or some other membrane-bound form of the proteins, such as a line assay. There are many variants of these tests. Some use purified viral proteins from cultured virus, while others may use recombinant proteins expressed from in vitro systems. Unbound antibodies are removed and those that are left bound are detected using secondary methods, similar to the principle of ELISA testing. The primary difference is that the particular proteins to which the patient has antibody responses can be determined. Negative, positive, or indeterminate results are interpreted based on the specific \"banding pattern\" of responses. Because test kits may use different modalities and different antigens from viral proteins, interpretation of a test must be performed according to the criteria for that specific test. Interpretation of banding patterns that have not been validated for that test may result in incorrect results. Antibody tests can distinguish between the different strains of HIV. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the 2 main species, and HIV-1 is further subdivided into groups M, N, and O. Some early tests were unable to detect the O \"outlier\" group or HIV-2; it would be inappropriate to use a modern test that was unable to detect all known groups and type the infection to either HIV-1 or HIV-2. Antibody tests are typically positive no sooner than 2 weeks after exposure, but seroconversion may take as long as several months. Thus, testing algorithms for exposed patients include baseline serology with repeat testing at 1, 3, and 6 months post exposure. Diagnosis in newborns Serology is not helpful in the context of diagnosing neonatal HIV infection, because maternal IgG transferred during the third trimester of pregnancy will cause positive ELISA and Western blot results in all infants born to HIV-infected mothers. In fact, this is sometimes exploited as part of newborn screening tests to detect HIV exposure. DNA polymerase chain reaction testing Confirmation of infection relies on more direct methods of detecting the virus. The most reliable method is DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. As a retrovirus, HIV has an RNA genome that is reverse-transcribed into a DNA intermediate stage. This DNA provirus is integrated into the host cellular genome, and from it all viral messenger RNA and viral genome RNA is transcribed. Proviral DNA can be detected in infected peripheral blood mononuclear calls using PCR amplification with HIV-specific primers. The use of proviral DNA PCR is generally limited to the specific situation of ruling out HIV infection in neonates. Initial testing should be performed as soon as possible after birth, and because transmission typically occurs at the time of delivery, repeated negative results are required to rule out infection. Optimally, exclusion of infection requires at least 2 further negative DNA PCR tests, one at 1 month of age and a second at 4 months. Including testing at birth, most neonates will therefore have at least 3 tests performed. Final confirmation of HIV status (either infected or uninfected) requires serologic tests. Negative antibody tests after 6 months of age can be used as proof of lack of infection, but maternal antibody to HIV can persist beyond 12 months of age, so definitive proof may be delayed, even with negative DNA PCR results. Almost all infants will have lost their maternal antibody by 18 months of age. RNA polymerase chain reaction testing Detection of viral RNA genomes through reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is an acceptable alternative for neonatal diagnosis, but it has some limitations. RNA viral testing in adults has been associated with false-positive results that have resulted in incorrect diagnoses. Conversely, if the infant is on antiretroviral therapy (most will be receiving zidovudine [AZT] monotherapy at least), viral replication may be inhibited, leading to negative RNA tests. DNA tests measure infected cells, and are therefore relatively unaffected by antiretroviral therapy. One setting where RNA testing may be useful is in diagnosing very early HIV infection. Antibodies may take several weeks to appear after acquisition of infection, so a person may be infected (and therefore infectious) but have negative serologic tests (ie, the \"window period\"). The level of HIV RNA in the peripheral blood (ie, the viral load) is very high during these initial weeks. RNA testing is discouraged for routine care; serologic tests several weeks after a possible exposure are preferred. However, qualitative RNA testing is approved for use in screening blood donations in combination with serologic tests. P24 Antigen P24 antigen is the 24 kilodalton (kD) peptide product cleaved from the center of the Gag polyprotein. It makes up the capsid of the viral particle, and is also known as the capsid antigen or CA. Historically, p24 antigenemia was found to be present in patients with AIDS and those with asymptomatic HIV infection. As a single test, the p24 antigen assay lacks sensitivity, but the assay has enjoyed a recent resurgence as part of combination HIV screening tests, alongside ELISA for antibodies. In theory, p24 antigenemia could be used to detect infected individuals during the window period before seroconversion, as the p24 level is relatively high during the time before the specific immune response can control HIV replication. The use of a combination HIV antigen/antibody screening assay was found to be superior in sensitivity and specificity for detecting early infections compared to an HIV RNA nucleic acid test. [ 9]  However, an analysis of healthcare costs suggested that the RNA-detection assay would result in more health care savings in the longer term. Viral culture Viral culture is possible but is labor intensive, requires specialist laboratory equipment and training (biosafety level 3 containment facilities) and may take several days to weeks to get results. It has no place in routine clinical diagnostics. Disease Management Before the first HIV tests were developed, many patients presented relatively late in infection and, as a consequence, progressed rapidly to death. Because of this, it was initially feared that HIV infection was generally a rapidly progressive disease. Together with the thought that aggressive antiretroviral therapy might prevent loss of immune responses, the concept of \"hit hard, hit early\" was born. Patients were started on therapy as soon as a diagnosis was made. This approach proved problematic with single-agent monotherapy, however, as drug resistance would inevitably arise within a few months. Even when effective combination therapy was developed, the side effects of the medications and demanding dosing regimens made compliance difficult. Patients who were asymptomatically infected often found their quality of life severely affected by starting therapy, and drug resistance could still occur, making treatment later on much more difficult. Over time, several studies led to the conclusion that a balance has to be struck between the hazards of delayed initiation of therapy and those of premature initiation. Current guidelines for treatment initiation rely on 3 measures: the patient’s clinical status (eg, past or current opportunistic infections [OIs], age), CD4 +  T cell count, and HIV peripheral viral load. [ 10]  Pretreatment testing Before starting antiretroviral therapy, certain laboratory tests are indicated if particular agents are being considered. Abacavir  is a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is associated with severe hypersensitivity reactions in 2-9% of patients, with those positive for HLA-B*5701 at the greatest risk. The reactions can be lethal. Thus, specific genetic testing for HLA-B*5701 should be performed prior to starting therapy with this drug. HIV requires an additional co-receptor for cell entry in addition to CD4. The co-receptor that HIV uses depends on the cell type: for CD4 +  T cells, it is CXCR4; for macrophages, it is CCR5. Early in infection, HIV almost exclusively uses the CCR5 co-receptor, but in many individuals there is a shift to using alternative receptors such as CXCR4. This shift has important implications for choosing antiretroviral regimens. Maraviroc  is a fusion inhibitor that blocks binding to the CCR5 co-receptor. Prior to starting therapy with maraviroc, viral tropism testing should be performed to confirm that CXCR4-trophic or dual-trophic strains are not present, as these would be quickly selected for, rendering treatment useless. In contrast, the fusion inhibitor  enfuvirtide  acts on the gp41 viral protein. This drug is active against CCR5, CXCR4, and dual-trophic strains of HIV-1. [ 11]  CD4 count HIV has a particular tropism for cells with the CD4 protein on their surface, which it binds to with the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Cells that have CD4 on their surface include macrophages, glial cells in the brain, and T-helper and T-regulatory cells. Macrophages are the site of a long-lived HIV proviral reservoir that makes eradication practically impossible. Loss of glial cells is thought to be related to AIDS-encephalopathy. [ 12]  CD4 +  T cells are lost through a number of mechanisms. HIV itself is directly cytotoxic to T cells, but cell death also occurs as part of the natural immune response and cell activation that occurs with any chronic infection. In the case of HIV, however, it appears as if T-cell replacement from the thymus is adversely affected, so an increased T-cell turnover is not compensated for by a concomitant increase in production. Long before these mechanisms were fully understood, it was clear that AIDS was characterized by a specific loss of CD4 +  T cells. CD8 +  T cells were relatively spared, leading to a reversal of the usual CD4/CD8 ratio. As a result of a loss of CD4 +  T cells, several areas of the immune system are affected. Because of a lack of T-cell help, both cellular CD8 responses and humoral antibody responses are less effective. CD8 +  cytotoxic T cells are less likely to respond to antigens, both ones that had previously produced positive responses and new targets. B cells, on the other hand, tend to overproduce IgG, leading to hypergammaglobulinemia, but the specificity of this antibody is poor, and overall this leads to impairment in antibody-mediated protection. Eventually, immune dysfunction progresses to the point that life-threatening OIs can occur. CD4 +  T cells can be readily measured by flow cytometry, using specific antibodies that label CD4 as well as other T cell markers such as CD3. Typically, CD4 counts are performed as part of a complete lymphocyte subset analysis, giving both percentages and absolute numbers of CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. The magnitude of discordance between absolute CD4 +  T-cell numbers and CD4 +  T-cell percentages is greatest in those HIV patients co-infected with active hepatitis C virus and more advanced liver disease. [ 13]  In adults, the absolute CD4 +  T-cell count carries the most influence. A count below 200 cells/mL has been associated in many studies with an increase in the relative risk of OIs. [ 14,  15]  In 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added a CD4 +  T-cell count below 200 cells/mL as a specific surveillance definition of AIDS. Prior to 1993, AIDS could be diagnosed only when an OI occurred in a patient infected with HIV. This change gave a much more accurate representation of those people with the highest risk of OIs and death. Early treatment guidelines used this level as the point at which treatment should be initiated, but several observations (and later, formal clinical trials) prompted a shift in the cutoff. Although no clear benefit could be seen in patients who started treatment at CD4 +  T-cell counts of 500/mL or above, those who wait until their counts are below 200/mL are less likely to have significant improvement in CD4 cell numbers, and they have reduced reconstitution of their immune repertoire (ie, the antigens to which their immune system could respond). Pretreatment CD4 count may have a prognostic role in predicting risk of death even after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. [ 16]  Formal studies of treatment initiation at various CD4 +  T-cell counts have shown that patients who start treatment when their count drops below 350/mL experience less morbidity and mortality than those who wait until their count drops below 200/mL. [ 17,  18,  19]  Current guidelines reflect this finding. In children, particularly infants, the absolute CD4 +  T-cell count may not accurately reflect their current risk of immune dysfunction, so the percentage is used instead. When CD4 +  T cells constitute less than 25% of total lymphocytes, relative deficiency is diagnosed. Absolute counts as high as 1000 cells/mL in children younger than 5 years may be an indication to start treatment. In very young infants infected perinatally, treatment should be started regardless of the CD4 +  T-cell count. [ 20,  21]  In adults with chronic hepatitis C and low absolute CD4 +  T cells, the CD4 percentage may also be more useful due to probable T-cell sequestration in the liver. [ 22]  Because CD4 +  T-cell counts decline over time in untreated individuals and may naturally vary from time to time, regular repeated testing is required to accurately assess the immune status of any given patient. Typically, it is recommended that CD4 +  T-cell counts be monitored every 3-12 months, depending on clinical status, to help with the timing of treatment initiation or to provide alerts for possible drug resistance or noncompliance with treatment. However, viral load provides a better measure of resistance and noncompliance. Monitoring therapy After starting therapy, there are often times when there is a need to alter the drugs used in the specific regimen, due to either clinical failure or an intolerance of side effects. Routine monitoring of viral load can help guide therapy before clinical failure occurs and can also assist with changing the antiretroviral regimen to address resistance when it occurs. HIV replication occurs primarily in lymphoid tissue, but high levels of viremia can be detected in infected individuals. Early studies made it clear that the level of viremia at the \"set point\" (ie, after acute infection, but prior to significant immune decline) was associated with the rate of CD4 +  T-cell loss and hence the time to AIDS and death. [ 14,  15]  One analogy is that if the CD4 +  T-cell count can be thought of as how far a train is from the end of the line, the viral load is a measure of how fast the train is going. Viral load can be considered a quantitative measure of viral RNA genomes in the peripheral circulation. The most common techniques involve some form of reverse transcription to convert viral RNA (which is readily destroyed by ubiquitous RNAses) to more easily manipulated DNA. After reverse transcription, the laboratory uses one of various amplification techniques that have been developed to provide a quantitative measure of the DNA. [ 23]  Most rely on some form of nucleic acid amplification such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Internal standards of amplification targets of known concentration are compared to patient specimens in order to provide quantitation of viral load. Because nucleic acid amplification techniques are incredibly sensitive, it is crucial to avoid contamination of specimens in the laboratory. Not only is the specific quantitative analysis of viral load important in clinical management, but qualitative viral load tests are used in screening of blood donations. Incorrect diagnoses of HIV infection have been made because of false-positive viral load assays (strictly speaking, these reflect an error on the part of the physician in ordering viral load testing instead of serology). Very high viral loads are associated with rapid progression to AIDS, and in the past, treatment initiation guidelines included viral load as part of the decision-making criteria. The most recent guidelines focus on the CD4 +  T-cell count as the preferred marker to assess treatment initiation, but viral load should be measured at baseline to assess response to treatment. An optimal response to treatment would be a reduction in the viral load to undetectable levels (for most assays, this equates to levels of less than 50 copies/mL, but some assays may be able to go lower). An occasional \"blip\" may occur; these are typically below 200 copies/mL, although false-positive quantitative RNA viral load tests can occur at counts under 1000/mL. For the purpose of monitoring therapy, the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents defines virologic failure as a confirmed viral load above 200 copies/mL. [ 10]  Resistance testing HIV rapidly develops resistance to antiretrovirals when they are used as single agents, but resistance can occur even with combination therapy. In addition, transmission of HIV from an individual who is already receiving therapy might result in drug-resistant virus being present even in treatment-naive individuals. For this reason, many experts recommend performing resistance testing before starting therapy. Nevertheless, the largest use of these tests is in the management of patients with established HIV disease. There are 2 main methods to detect antiretroviral resistance in HIV: genotypic and phenotypic testing. Both are usually performed in specialist laboratories. Genotypic testing relies on the fact that many drug-resistance mutations have been well described and characterized from in vitro work or patient specimens. [ 24]  Amplification and sequencing of target areas of the genome can provide rapid detection of probable resistance mutations to several antiretroviral medications simultaneously. The main limitations of genotypic testing are that sufficient virus must be present for testing (low viral load tends to render this testing insensitive but, arguably, also redundant) and that only those mutations known to confer drug resistance can be tested for. In addition, the presence of low-level resistance might be missed in a mixed population of viral pseudospecies, a situation that often exists in persons infected with HIV. In general, this subpopulation would be expected to expand in the face of pressure from treatment, and later testing should detect it. Phenotypic testing is performed with actual viral culture, testing the virus’s ability to replicate in the presence of antiretroviral drugs. It too relies on sufficient virus being present to test and is limited in that it is more labor intensive. It may, however, be better at detecting mixed populations of resistant and sensitive pseudospecies. Schematic of enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) technique. 1) viral antigen is bound to a solid...

				"body": "Overview Neurologic complications occur in more than 40% of patients with  HIV infection . They are the presenting feature of AIDS in 10-20% of cases. At autopsy, the prevalence of neuropathologic abnormalities is 80%. [ 1,  2,  3,  4]  Although an ongoing decline in HIV-associated CNS disease has been observed in very recent years, the mortality from these diseases remains high. [ 5]  Types of CNS complications Several different types of CNS complications accompany HIV infection. Conditions that may be caused, directly or indirectly, by HIV itself include the following: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND syndrome) [ 6]  Vacuolar myelopathy Certain peripheral neuropathies Conditions caused by infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic processes secondary to immunodeficiency include the following: CNS lymphoma Kaposi sarcoma Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Fungal infections (eg,  cryptococcal meningitis ,  Penicillium marneffei  encephalitis [ 7]  Tuberculous meningitis Cerebrovascular diseases [ 8,  9]  Certain neuropathies and myopathies Toxoplasmosis Neurocysticercosis Cytomegalovirus (CMV)  encephalitis Some neurologic conditions are caused by antiretroviral drugs. In addition, AIDS patients are susceptible to the same neurologic diseases as patients who do not have HIV infection. In AIDS, a clinical presentation often cannot be explained with a single diagnosis. New-onset neurologic complications often are superimposed on an ongoing process with a different etiology. Clinical features reflect the sum of deficits at several anatomic sites. CNS complications in children The manifestations of AIDS and its neurologic complications differ in children, whose immune and nervous systems are infected at an immature stage, whether in utero, during delivery, or postpartum. CNS complications tend to progress more rapidly in children, probably because of the inability of their immune systems to mount an appropriate T-cell, B-cell, or cytokine response to the infection. Neurologic involvement in HIV infection is more frequent in children than in adults. It may take the form of a loss of previously acquired intellectual and motor milestones or of developmental delay. Opportunistic infections due to reactivation of dormant organisms are unusual, as children may not have been exposed yet to the responsible organisms. Distinguishing features include blood vessel calcification in the basal ganglia, large necrotizing cortical and subcortical lesions, microcephaly, and infection of astrocytes. Neurologic immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome Neurologic immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (NeuroIRIS) is a newly recognized complication of combination antiretroviral therapy. [ 10]  In a recent retrospective study of 461 patients started on combination antiretroviral therapy, 7 patients (0.7%) developed NeuroIRIS. [ 11]  In general, the risk of IRIS appears to be high in patients whose CD4+ lymphocyte count is below 50 cells/mL at the start of antiretroviral therapy. [ 12]  Associated cerebrovascular diseases Specific types of cerebrovascular disease are associated with HIV infection. In addition, with improved treatment and prolonged survival, more HIV-infected patients reach an older age and are at risk for cerebrovascular diseases unrelated to HIV infection. HIV-positive patients may suffer transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or hemorrhagic, thrombotic, or embolic strokes. A Danish population study showed that HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of stroke with and without proven risk factors. Low CD4 cell count at the start of antiretroviral therapy and exposure to abacavir, but not with HAART, were important risk factors seen in this population. [ 13]  HIV-positive patients are at risk for strokes at much younger ages than typically are associated with stroke. As in the HIV-seronegative population, age itself is a risk factor for stroke in HIV-infected individuals. Patient education information For patient education information, see the  Dementia Center ,  Immune System Center , and  Sexually Transmitted Diseases Center , as well as  Dementia Due to HIV Infection  and  HIV/AIDS . Pathophysiology When immune defenses are impaired, opportunistic infections and neoplasms arise, often from reactivation of previously acquired organisms. This mechanism applies to agents such as  Toxoplasma gondii  and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); the latter is strongly associated with CNS lymphoma. Other organisms, such as the JC or SV40 viruses that cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, may be activated directly by HIV gene products. The likelihood of a particular neurologic syndrome correlates with the clinical stage of HIV infection as reflected by viral load, immune response, and CD4 +  lymphocyte counts. This, in turn, is related to the severity of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity and to serum and tissue cytokine levels. Manifestations of acute HIV infection are often subclinical but may include meningitis, acute encephalopathy with seizures, confusion, and delirium. HIV enters the CNS soon after initial infection. Early peripheral nerve manifestations include isolated acute cranial nerve palsies and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Neurologic complications seen in AIDS include AIDS dementia complex, vacuolar myelopathy, opportunistic infections and neoplasms, and chronic neuropathies (usually several years after HIV infection). Neurologic immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome NeuroIRIS manifests several weeks after the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy. There is a paradoxical clinical deterioration despite improving CD4 cell counts and viral load. Antiretroviral-naive patients are at particular risk independent of baseline CD4+ counts. NeuroIRIS is an uncommon complication of combination antiretroviral therapy but has a very poor outcome. Cerebrovascular disease AIDS seems to confer additional risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke independent of other stroke-related risk factors. Some mechanisms responsible for strokes, both nonspecific and specific to HIV, include hypertension, hypotension, cardiac disease, illicit drug use, coagulopathy, vasculitis (infectious, autoimmune), and hemorrhage (including hemorrhage into neoplasms and abscesses), but other mechanisms may be operative that are less well understood. Premature atherosclerotic cerebral arteriopathy associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)–induced metabolic disorders has become an additional risk factor in patients with AIDS. Several studies have documented subclinical cervical artery atherosclerosis, as assessed by intima-media thickness, ultrasound detection of carotid artery plaques, and intracerebral small-vessel disease, all being associated with the induced metabolic changes. [ 9]  Carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression are increasingly being used to predict vascular risk. A 3-year follow-up study of 255 HIV-infected adults found that although c-IMT and CAC progression rates were higher than expected for their respective age and risk groups, traditional cardiovascular risk factors are the strongest predictors of carotid and coronary atherosclerotic disease progression in this population. Aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction slows progression of atherosclerosis in patients with preexisting disease. [ 14]  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of CNS complications in HIV-infected patients includes  herpes simplex encephalitis ,  cerebrovascular complications ,  meningitis ,  CNS cryptococcosis ,  CNS toxoplasmosis ,  cytomegalovirus encephalitis ,  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ,  CNS lymphoma ,  vacuolar myelopathy , and  HIV-1 encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex . Other problems to be considered include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), brainstem syndromes, and efavirenz-related side effects. Efavirenz has been implicated in relation to various short- and long-term neuropsychiatric side effects, including mood lability, concentration difficulties, nightmares, and anxiety. [ 15]  Diagnostic Testing A consultant often faces the challenge of differentiating slow progression of HIV-associated dementia, myelopathy, or neuropathy from an acute, new-onset process such as infection with cytomegalovirus or toxoplasmosis. Such intervening conditions must be diagnosed rapidly and appropriate treatment initiated expeditiously. Failure to recognize a potentially reversible condition that is fatal if not treated would constitute deviation from the standard of care. Multiple ancillary tests need to be performed, even when the level of suspicion is relatively low. Imaging studies often make diagnoses rather than just confirming them. The most sensitive study is often MRI with and without gadolinium (or other contrast agents). If MRI is not available or if patient motion is expected to compromise the image, head CT scan without and with intravenous contrast is the next best solution. Algorithmic Approach for Evaluation and Treatment Several algorithms have been developed for the evaluation and treatment of adult HIV-seropositive patients with neurologic symptoms and signs. [ 16]  These algorithms proceed through several branch points, depending on the results of previous tests. CT and MRI A brain CT scan or MRI with and without contrast is indicated for all patients presenting with altered mental status, headaches, seizures, or focal neurologic signs. MRI is clearly the superior technique but is not available universally. If this initial imaging study is normal, or shows atrophy or focal signal abnormalities but no mass lesion, diagnostic consideration should be given to meningitides, AIDS dementia complex (ADC), or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Open biopsy with decompression If imaging shows one or more focal mass lesions with impending herniation, an open biopsy with decompression is indicated. The rarity of toxoplasmosis in children may warrant a brain biopsy without any preceding studies. Treatment for lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or other opportunistic infections and neoplasms is initiated depending on results. T SPECT or If imaging shows one or more focal mass lesions without impending herniation, additional studies are warranted. When available, thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography ( 201  T SPECT) or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18  FDG-PET) scan in conjunction with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for Epstein-Barr virus can provide strong evidence that a mass lesion represents a lymphoma. This may reduce the need for a stereotactic biopsy. When these studies cannot be conducted, toxoplasmosis serology in conjunction with imaging results will determine how to proceed. Further testing/treatment In cases of a single mass lesion and negative serology, a stereotactic brain biopsy is indicated. [ 17]  In cases of multiple lesions with negative or positive serology, therapy for toxoplasmosis should be initiated. In cases of multiple or single lesions with positive serology, therapy for toxoplasmosis should be initiated. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) must be considered in patients who deteriorate clinically or radiologically after starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite improving viral load and CD4 count. Treatment remains empirical; some patients respond to steroids. ",

				"body": "Overview Background Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a T-cell–mediated defense mechanism against microbes that survive within phagocytes or infect nonphagocytic cells. CMI functions to enhance antimicrobial actions of phagocytes to eliminate microbes. CMI manifests as delayed type cellular immune responses as typically seen in Mantaux test. This T-cell–mediated activation of phagocytes depends on interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a major cytokine produced by type 1 T-helper (Th1) cells. However, anti-IFN-γ neutralizing antibodies (Abs) do not completely abrogate CMI. IFN-γ or IFN-γR knock out (KO) mice do reveal attenuated CMI. These results indicate that CMI cannot be solely attributed to IFN-γ – mediated Th1 responses. The identification of Th17 cells, which produce interleukins (ILs) – 17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and many other factors shed a light on the previously observed CMI in the absence of IFN-)γ. IL-17 KO mice did display attenuated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) against bovine serum albumin and bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). [ 1]  The role of Th17 and Th1 cells in CMI may vary depending on stimulants. [ 2]  Phagocytic cell activation and inflammation induced by CMI can cause tissue injury, typically called delayed-type hypersensitivity. In experimental animal models, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are characterized by a granulomatous response consisting of macrophages, monocytes, and T lymphocytes. In skin, keratinocytes are also thought to have a role. DTH responses in the skin have been used to assess CMI in vivo. An antigen (Ag) is introduced intradermally (ID), and induration and erythema at 48-72 hours postinjection indicate a positive reaction. Positive responses require the subject's exposure to the Ag at least 4-6 weeks prior to skin testing. The lack of a DTH response to a recall Ag is often regarded as an evidence of anergy. In the absence of underlying diseases, anergy may indicate primary or secondary T-cell immunodeficiency. The prototype recall Ag is  Mycobacterium tuberculosis ; other commonly used Ags for DTH responses in humans include  tetanus ,  Candida  and  Trichophyton  species, and  mumps . Several fungi and streptococci Ags are no longer available or not recommended for clinical use. DTH responses in the skin can also occur as contact hypersensitivity (CH) to certain chemicals, including nickel, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and picryl chloride. DTH reaction can also occur with various medications, including sulfonamides, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. These small chemicals are believed to act as haptens or activate T cells by directly binding to T cell Ag receptor (TCRs)/major histocompatibility complex (MHC). [ 3]  Originally, CH was thought to be skin DTH reaction. However, recent studies indicate that CH can be caused by different immune mechanisms. That is, in CH, CD4 +  T cells are major effector cells, with CD8 +  cell playing a regulatory role at least in certain model systems. In rodents, chemically induced CH was reported by attenuated by recombinant IFN-γ. [ 2]  CH induced by chemicals is enhanced by IL-17A, which induces production of IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, and upregulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in human keratinocytes. [ 1,  2]  In addtion, IL-4 KO mice revealed attenuated CH responses. [ 4]  Cytotoxic CD8 +  T cells that produce IL-17A (Tc17 cells) are also implicated in induction of CH in rodent models. [ 5]  Thus, at least in rodent models, Th17 and Th2 cytokines have a role in induction of CH; Th17 cells produce IL-17A, and Th2 cells are a major source of IL-4. Pathophysiology A DTH reaction in the skin is initiated when certain Ags are presented by Ag-presenting cells (APCs) (ie, Langerhans cells to sensitized memory T cells). The Ag presentation and subsequent T-cell activation via CD3 and T-cell Ag receptor (TCR)(CD3/TCR) complex elicit an influx of macrophages, monocyte, and lymphocytes at the site of Ag exposure. These cells then produce inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-17A, and IFN-γ. At the onset of the DTH reaction, vasopermeability is increased by serotonin and histamine, and adhesion molecules are up-regulated in the vascular endothelium, so that additional cellular components migrate into the local site of Ag presentation. The APCs present Ags complex in the groove of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the cell surface of the APCs. For most proten antigens or haptens associated with DTH skin reaction, CD4 +  T cells are presented with Ags bound to MHC class II alleles, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, -DP, and –DQ. Specific MHC class II alleles are associated with excessive immune activation to certain Ags. For example, abacavir, an antiviral drug, causes severe adverse drug reactions exclusively in subjects with HLA variant B*57:01. Abacavir reactions are driven by drug-specific activation of cytotoxic CD8 +  cells and this is implicated with abacavir's binding to the F pocket of the peptide-binding groove of HLA-B*57:01, resulting in alloreactive T-cell responses. [ 6]  T cells recognize Ags through TCRs, which are composed of heterodimers containing constant and variable regions (TCR α/ß and TCR γ/δ) analogous to the constant and variable regions of immunoglobulin. Most delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are elicited through TCR α/β T cells. TCR γ/δ is commonly expressed on T cells in the epithelium boundaries with limited TCR diversities. The function of TCR γ/δ T cells are not well understood in humans. Ag elicited TCR activation is mediated by CD3 composed of γ, δ, and ε proteins and intracellular ζ chains. This CD3/TCR complex activation requires additional signaling mediated by CD4 or CD8 molecules which are physically associated with the CD3/TCR complex. In addition, Ag-mediated TCR activation requires Ag-independent signaling via co-stimulatory molecules which are not physically associated with the CD3/TCR complex. Co-stimulatory molecules that mediate activation signals such as CD28 and ICOS are constitutively expressed on T cells while inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules such as CTLA-4 (CD152) and PD-1 are up-regulated following T cell activation to abrogate excessive inflammatory responses. DTH responses to some organisms are predominantly mediated by CD8 +  cytotoxic T cells and effector stage Th1 cells augment CD8 +  T cell activation. CD8 +  T cells activate macrophages via CD40-CD40L interactions and production of Th1 cytokines including IFN-γ. The differences in T cell immune responses to intracellular microbes determine disease outcomes in certain diseases. For example, ineffective CMI is observed in patients with lepromatous leprosy with high  Mycobacteria leprae  load in macrophages and destructive skin lesions. While, in tuberculoid leprosy, strong CMI induces granulomas with less  M Leprae  load but severe sensory nerve defects. IFN-γ is the key cytokine that plays the dominant role in DTH and is a major activator of macrophage-monocyte lineage cells; it augments phagocytic function and production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). IFN-γ also up-regulate T cell activation markers (CD69, CD71, CD25, and HLA-DR) and MHC molecules on APCs, promotes differentiation of Th1 cells while suppressing Th2 cell differentiation, and promote isotype switching of antibody (Ab) to facilitate Ab-mediated phagocytic cell immune responses. Recent studies also revealed a role of Th17 cells that produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22. [ 1,  2,  7,  8]  IL-17A was reported to amplify human contact hypersensitivity (CH) by rendering keratinocytes to susceptible to ICAM-1 dependent, Ag-non-specific T cell killing. [ 9]  IFN-γ also exerts regulatory actions on CD4 +  Th cells. [ 10]  IFN-γ affects activation-induced cell death of Th cells, contributing to lymphocyte homeostasis. IFN-γ is also reported to covert CD4 +  CD25 -  Th cells into inducible CD4 +  CD25 +  regulatory T (Treg) cells by inducing Foxp3 expression. Lack of such IFN-γ actions is likely associated with excessive DTH reactions in patients with defects of IL-12–IFN-γ signaling pathways, which results in lack of IFN-γ actions. TNF-α is also essential for DTH responses. Major cellular sources of TNF-α include macrophages and Th1 cells but this cytokine is also produced by many other lineage cells. TNF-α induces chemokine production from macrophages and endothelial cells and it also up-regulates expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells, resulting in massive influx of inflammatory cells. In DTH responses to poison ivy and nickel, mast cells are likely a major source of TNF-α, in addition to production of other inflammatory mediators including histamine. TNF-α also induces inflammatory cytokines including IL-1. In rodent models of DTH, IL-1 but not IL-33 was found to be crucial for IFN-γ induced DTH reactions. [ 11]  Another key cytokine associated with DTH responses is IL-12. IL-12 is mainly produced by APC and Th1 cells. IL-12 augments production of IFN-γ and promotes Th1 cell differentiation. It also enhances cytolytic actions of NK and CD8 +  T cells. IL-18 was also shown to augment IFN-γ production in the presence of IL-12. Osteopontin (OPN), a phosphoglycoprotein produced in the tissue, has also a role for promoting Th1 and Th17 driven DTH by supporting APC migration and IL-12 expression. [ 12,  13]  A defect in DTH reaction is best illustrated in the gene mutations of IFN-γ and IL-12 pathways. Gene mutation of IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) is characterized by ineffective granuloma formation and disseminated infection of atypical  Mycobacterium  species, BCG, and  Salmonella  species. The  IFNGR1  gene consists of 7 exons (50 kb) and is highly polymorphic. Mutations identified thus far include frameshift deletions, insertion, a splice mutation, and missense mutations at the up-stream end of the gene. These mutations generally lead to absence of IFN-γ receptor protein expression or nonfunctional binding sites of IFN-γR for IFN-γ. This leads to impaired macrophage activation and resultant decreased production of TNF-α and ROIs. The gene mutations of  IFNGR2  also cause similar clinical pictures. In contrast, mutations in IFNGR1 at a downstream hotspot disrupt the intracytoplasmic domain and result in a dominantly expressed disorder with milder clinical features. [ 14]  TH17 and Tc17 cells are also implicated with DTH and CH responses. For example, nickel-specific Th clones established from patients with nickel CH was shown to produce IL-17A. Down-regulation of CMI in the immunocompetent host is an active process and important for minimizing tissue injury caused by DTH. Counter-regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 down-regulate production of Th1/Th17 cytokines or counteracts to Th1/Th17 cytokines. Naturally occurring and inducible regulatory T (Treg) cells also play a crucial role in this process, partly via production of IL-10 and TGF-ß. Drugs that block components of DTH responses include antihistamines, histamine 2 (H2) receptor antagonists, and prostaglandin antagonists such as indomethacin. As indicated before, IFN-γ can augment induction of inducible Treg cells that produce IL-10 and TGF-ß in the late stage of DTH–induced inflammation to self-limit DTH reactions. [ 10]  . It should be noted that effector Th cells can change lineage-specific functions depending on the microenvironment. That is, Th17 cells can acquire the ability of secreting Th1 cytokines and Th17 cells can also switch to Treg phenotype. [ 7,  8]  Such flexibility is thought to be helpful for maintaining immune homeostasis and minimizing tissue damage associated with DTH responses in addition to effective microbial clearance. Epidemiology Frequency United States More than 80% of healthy children aged 12-36 months mount positive DTH skin test reactivity to a  Candida  antigen. In the absence of a skin DTH response, evaluating CMI with in vitro lymphocyte proliferative responses to the specific Ag is necessary to confirm the anergic state. Anergy is observed in patients with malnutrition, severe  atopic dermatitis , and severe infections caused by  M tuberculosis,  measles, mumps,  HIV ,  influenza ,  mononucleosis , lepromatous leprosy, and certain fungi. Anergy is also observed in patients who have recently received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, patients with  sarcoidosis , or patients with parasitic infestations. In addition, immunosuppressive drugs, such as cytotoxic medications and corticosteroids, lead to anergy. Malignancy, especially malignant lymphomas, also induces anergy. It should be noted that DTH reactions in patients with impaired IFN-γ and IL-12/IL-23 pathways tend to reveal excessive DTH reactions. In contrast, in patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive hyper immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome with  STAT3  mutations or DOCK 8 deficiency, decreased DTH responses against  Candida  may be observed due to deficiency of Th17 cells. [ 15,  16]  International DTH reactivity to tuberculin is elicited by BCG vaccination. BCG is the most commonly administered vaccine throughout the world; however, it is not used in the United States. Mortality/Morbidity DTH skin testing is almost never associated with mortality or morbidity. The major error is associated with failure of differentiating anergy from negative DTH reactivity. Anergy may result from overwhelming infection such as sepsis or immunodeficiency. Secondary immunodeficiency is commonly due to therapy with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, calcineurin inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and various monoclonal antibodies directed against the immune system. Patients with T-cell immunodeficiency diseases such as  severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)  are anergic. Patients with mutations in  IL12P40  or in  IL12RB1  may show a positive, often excessive, DTH reactivity through activation of other components of DTH responses such as IL-17 and perhaps due to lack of regulatory effects of IFN-γ. Mutations in  IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P40,  and  IL12RB1  are autosomal recessive. Mutations found in complete IFN-γR deficiency are also autosomal recessive. Mutations in  IFNGR1  that affect the downstream intracytoplasmic domain are autosomal dominant and are manifested as partial IFN-γR deficiency with less severe clinical manifestations. Patients with complete IFN-γR deficiency often succumb to death from overwhelming infection caused by nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) and BCG at young age. Severe  cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection  is also described in these patients. Mutations partially impairing IFN-γ signaling pathway may be manifested with milder mycobacterial infection, nontyphus  Salmonella  infection,  Legionella  infection, and listeriosis. Race Some individuals from the Mediterranean area have mutations leading to insufficient IFN-γ function. Specifically, a family from Tunisia, several families from Malta, and 1 family from Italy have been reported. Genetic defects involving the IFN-γ/IL-12 axis are now increasingly reported in other races. Sex Anergy to BCG and of idiopathic disseminated BCG infection are equally distributed among males and females. As expected in autosomal recessive gene mutations,  IFNGR1, IL12P40,  and  IL12RB1  mutations are found with equal frequency in males and females. Age DTH reactivity to  Candida  Ag can be detected in infants as young as 3-4 months, but reactivity depends on exposure to the candida Ag. Positive DTH reactivity to tetanus toxoid requires completion of the primary immunization series of 3 injections administered 4-6 weeks apart; only one third of infants have a positive response to tetanus after the first dose of DTaP immunization. Patients with  IFNGR1/IFNGR2  mutations that cause complete loss of IFN-receptor expression or IFN-γ–mediated signaling have presented as infants or in early childhood with disseminated BCG or NTM infections. This age-related infection seems to reflect the age of exposure to the causative organisms. Clinical Presentation History Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing is usually performed to detect exposure to  tuberculosis  and, occasionally, when unusually extensive  Candida  infection has occurred. In these settings, the patient often has no prior history of unusually severe or opportunistic infections. In developing countries, ruling out confounding clinical malnutrition and rubeola infection that negate DTH skin test reactivity is crucial. HIV infection, sarcoidosis, and malignancies, such as  Hodgkin lymphoma  , also cause negate DTH responses. Overwhelming infection such as sepsis is also known to cause suppresed DTH responses. One study indicated that this is mediated by CD8 +  Treg cells through a TRAIL-dependent mechanisms and these cells are induced by apoptotic cells. [ 17]  The presence of any cause for immunosuppression modifies the interpretation of tuberculin DTH skin tests; in an immunosuppressive condition, 5-mm induration is interpreted as a positive response. DTH skin reactions are absent in patients with lepromatous leprosy ( M leprae ), sarcoidosis,  coccidioidomycosis ,  schistosomiasis , rheumatological diseases, severe viral infections (eg, influenza, mononucleosis, mumps), and those given the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine recently (≤3 wk). Systemic steroid therapy can cause anergy; however, inhaled steroids with high bioavailability could also decrease DTH reactions and less frequently produce anergy when administered in large doses. Longer duration (>2 wk) and higher doses of oral steroids increase the risk for anergy, but no exact doses or duration predict induction of anergy in a given individual. Other immunosuppressive agents that cause anergy include cancer chemotherapy agents, calcineurin inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies against the immune system such as anti-TNF and anti-CD20 agents. Usually, a patient with anergy caused by a T-cell immunodeficiency can be identified before wasting sets in. A pattern of unusually frequent or severe common infections, extensive mucocutaneous candidiasis, or dermatitis together with lymphopenia raises the suspicion of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or other severe T-cell immunodeficiencies. A patient with disseminated BCG or NTM infection may have a history of consanguinity or familial infection, indicating autosomal recessive genetic disorders. It is necessary to evaluate these patients for  IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P40,  and  IL12RB1  mutations. Patients with BCG infection usually present in early infancy after administration of the BCG vaccine. NTM infection develops more typically in mid childhood when community exposure to these mycobacteria occurs. A patient with one of the above mutations responds poorly to appropriate anti-mycobacterial therapy and often has a fulminant fatal infection. Nontyphus  Salmonella  infections are more frequently observed in patients with the above-described disorders.  Asthma , atopy, and immune complex disease (eg, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, positive rheumatoid factors) are sometimes present. Repetitive DTH skin testing does not change the parameters used to define a positive test result. DTH antigens for coccidioidomycosis are no longer available. Diagnosis depends on identifying the organism or serology. Negative skin test reactivity to coccidioidin does correlate with a less favorable clinical outcome. However, the positive skin test result usually persists following an initial infection so that recurrence cannot be determined by the DTH skin testing. DTH skin test reactivities for histoplasmosis and blastomycosis cross-react. In addition, positive DTH skin reactions in exposed but not infected individuals living in endemic areas confound interpretation. Both fungal infections have increased in incidence in HIV patients; these patients are frequently anergic. Diagnosis now requires culturing the organism, antigen/DNA detection, and/or serologic confirmation. Physical The DTH response in the skin is determined by the extent of induration. Erythema indicates an immediate hypersensitivity reaction and begins earlier than induration but often persists even after induration has developed. DTH skn test to most antigens is read as positive when induration is 5 mm or more at 48 hours and 72 hours following inoculation. For tuberculin, 15 mm is considered a positive response for persons aged 4 years or older without risk factors; 10 mm is considered a positive response for younger children and those in populations with increased exposure or in whom immunosuppression is likely. A tuberculin reaction of 5 mm is considered positive when clinical evidence of tuberculosis, HIV infection, or close contact with people with infectious tuberculosis is noted. Disseminated BCG and NTM infection are characterized by fever, wasting,  lymphadenopathy , and hepatosplenomegaly. Causes A positive DTH response to the purified protein derivative (PPD) of  M tuberculosis  is elicited 4-6 weeks after exposure to  M. tuberculosis . Populations at increased risk for tuberculosis include immigrants from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis, such as African, Asian, and South American countries, and those with HIV infection. High-risk populations in the United States include those who are incarcerated, those who are homeless, migrant workers, and those who use illicit drugs. Individuals who are exposed to these populations are also at increased risk. Anergy is discussed under History and Pathophysiology. A single functional mature T cell can transfer DTH reactions; thus, a patient who received  hematopoietic stem cell transplant  from a donor with positive DTH responses to the specific antigen could reveal positive DTH responses to the same antigen. Contact DTH reactions (contact hypersensitivity [CH]) occur in patients with poison ivy and nickel hypersensitivity DTH to sulfonamides, phenytoin, and carbamazepine has been described. Reactions to penicillin-type antibiotics may be cell-mediated, but immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated responses are much more common. Genetic factors in CH are not well understood but studies targeting candidate genes revealed association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of some candidate genes in development of CH. These genes include  NAT1 ,  NAT2 ,  GSTT ,  ACE ,  TNF , and  IL-16 . [ 18]  Workup Laboratory Studies Characteristics of the Ags determine delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test reactivity. Conjugation of the Ag to lipids facilitates DTH reaction. This explains the consistent response to mycobacteria in which Ag are isolated from the lipid cell wall. Size, valence, chemical composition, and dose are additional factors that are relevant to immunogenicity. Repetitive testing with the same Ag can cause an immediate IgE-mediated response and may diminish the DTH skin test reactivity. High doses of Ag that induce predominant Th2 responses, such as in miliary tuberculosis, abrogate the DTH responses by a negative feedback mechanism elicited by Th2 responses. By convention, the Ags used for DTH skin testing are injected intradermally into the volar surface of the forearm with a volume of 0.1 mL each. Erythema and induration are measured at 24, 48, and 72 hours. A reaction at 24 hours does not represent DTH induced by CMI, or type IV reactivity. The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  –approved antigens for DTH skin testing are limited to PPD and  Candida  Ag. Conventionally, children are tested with  Candida  and  Dermatophytin  in a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution and tested with tetanus in a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of the diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccine. The higher dilution is used when the child has undergone a significant infection or unusually frequent immunization respectively. Adults are initially tested with the 1:100 concentrations of these Ags. When interpreting DTH skin reactivity, whether adequate exposure to the Ags has taken place prior to the procedure must be considered. A vigorous immune response to one Ag, such as in measles infection, leads to the abrogation of other DTH responses, for example, to PPD even though the patient is also infected with tuberculosis. Ags that are poorly immunogenic in children and in some adults include mumps (no longer on the US market) and  Trichophyton . Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) have been superseded by in vitro assessments of CMI because of the risk of local tissue necrosis. When an absent DTH reaction is noted, screening tests for a T-cell disorder should include enumeration of T and B cell subsets, and a chest radiograph to detect the thymus. Cell surface marker analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by flow cytometry and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses or production of T cell cytokins in response to mitogens (polyclonal stimulants) and recall antigens are also indicated. Contact hypersensitivity to poison ivy and nickel is determined clinically; skin testing is not considered necessary. Nickel DTH reaction can be assessed by patch skin testing. Adverse drug reactions to antibiotics, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may involve non-immune or immune-mediated mechanisms. The clinical setting of a reaction at 3 days or later with manifestation of a fixed rash with induration is more suspicious of involvement of a DTH response. Imaging Studies A chest radiograph to determine whether the thymus is present is an appropriate screening test for T-cell disorders only in the newborn period and early infancy; however, the thymus may involute in stressed infants in the context of overwhelming infection or severe congenital cardiac disease. Other Tests When DTH response is absent and a T-cell immunodeficiency is suspected, testing T-cell functions in vitro is indicated. Typically, lymphocyte proliferation responses against polyclonal stimulants such as mitogens (eg, phytohemagglutinins [PHA], concanavalin A [conA], pokeweed mitogen [PWM]) and specific antigens (eg,  Candida,  tetanus) are assessed. Measurement of production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-12 in response to various stimulants can also be helpful for screening severe T cell immunodeficiency as well as in mutations in  IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P40,  or  IL12RB1  when such mutations are suspected. Low levels of one or more of these cytokines increase the likelihood of these mutations. In patients with severe eczema, recurrent skin abscesses, elevated IgE, and history of frequent bone fractures, assessment of IL-17 production or IL-17 expression in Th cells may be helpful. This is because patients with hyper-IgE syndrome caused by  STAT3  mutation or DOCK8 deficiency have impaired development of Th17 cells, which is a major cellular source of IL-17. [ 15,  16]  Cell surface markers for monocytes, T-cells (CD4, CD8, CD28, TCR α/β, TCR γ/δ), and activated T cells (CD25, HLA-DR, and CD5) are reported to be normal in  IFNGR1, IL12P40,STAT1, IL12RB1, STAT3  mutations. In profound primary T-cell deficiencies such as SCID, the pattern of cell surface marker expression of lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cells may identify the type of T-cell defect in conjunction with the clinical manifestations. Mutational analysis for  IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT-1,STAT-3, IL12P40,  and  IL12RB1  is available in commercial laboratories and/or specific research laboratories. Additional genes that control downstream immune responses initiated by IFN-γ in the DTH response are recognized;  IFNGR2  does not bind IFN-γ but is needed for the activation of  STAT-1  and its translocation to the nucleus. Procedures See the list below: When disseminated BCG or NTM is suspected, perform biopsy of infected sites in order to examine granuloma formation and detect acid-fast mycobacteria. Tissue culture to detect mycobacteria is also indicated when disseminated BCG or NTM is suspected. Histologic Findings See the list below: Granuloma formation in an intact DTH response shows predominant infiltrates of activated macrophages and lymphocytes that can be identified as CD4 +  T cells by immunohistochemical staining. When NTM infection is present, multinucleated giant cells formed by fused activated macrophages are observed in the immunocompetent host. In the patient with a T-cell defect, the formed granuloma lacks CD4 +  T cells and these giant cells (due to ineffective macrophage activation by T cells). Instead, granulomatous lesions are characterized by infiltrate of polymorphonuclear cells, vacuolated cells, and macrophages. Mycobacteria may be present in abundance but are not frequently stained, although they are isolated by culture techniques. Treatment & Management Medical Care Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing requires the use of Ag doses as defined under Lab Studies. See Lab Studies for a more complete discussion of the interpretation of DTH reactions. DTH responses represent cellular immune responses to recall Ags to which the subject has been exposed at least 4-6 weeks previously. The reaction occurs 48-72 hours after exposure and induces induration of 5 mm or more. The inflammatory reaction may be sufficient to induce pain at the local site. Topical steroids and diphenhydramine have been used to decrease an unusually severe local reaction. If an excessive reaction is anticipated, such as in caseating tuberculosis, decrease the amount of Ag; for  M tuberculosis,  for example, decrease the strength of the PPD from the customary 5 units to 1 unit. Negative reactions to a recall Ag to which the patient is known to have adequate exposure require investigation for an underlying illness or a T-cell immunodeficiency. Positive DTH reactions do not indicate protection against the recall Ag that is tested. Antibody responses to the specific antigen usually reveal better correlation with immune protection. In patients with mutations in the IFN)-γ/IL-12/IL-23 signaling pathways, medical care includes consideration of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with severe deficiencies and exogenous IFN-γ therapy in patients with partial deficiencies with milder clinical features. In the presence of NTM infection, patients require treatment with an aggressive regimen of anti-mycobacterial drugs. HSCT may not be successful in the presence of systemic, progressive NTM infection. Consultations In a context in which a T-cell disorder is likely, a clinical immunologist should manage the diagnostic workup in order to obtain informative cell-mediated immunologic testing and appropriate mutational analysis. Both types of evaluations for rare T-cell disorders are commonly available only in laboratories of specific investigators. However, intracellular cytokine staining of IL-17 and mutational analysis of genes associated with deficiencies of IFN-γ and IL-12 pathways can be attainable in the commercial laboratories. Diet Resolution of protein-energy malnutrition in immunocompetent hosts induces an intact DTH response. Follow-up Further Inpatient Care Consider patients with most T-cell disorders for stem cell transplantation, usually by bone marrow transplantation using a HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. Only a few cases of  bone marrow transplantation (BMT)  have been reported in patients with mutations in the interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 signaling pathways with rather unfavorable results. Intact T-cell functions other than IFN-γ/IL-12/IL-23 axis increases the risk of graft rejection and concurrent NTM infection usually present at the time of BMT increase the risk of post-BMT complications. [ 19,  20]  Deterrence/Prevention Patients in whom immunodeficiency causing impaired CMI is suspected should never receive the BCG or smallpox vaccine. Similarly, live vaccines (MMR and varicella) are contraindicated, although this vaccine is not administered until age 1 year, by which time most T-cell disorders have been diagnosed.  Guidelines regarding the administration of the MMR vaccine have been updated . [ 21]  Patients with  IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P40,  or  IL12RB1  mutations are advised to receive prophylaxis against NTM using rifabutin and clarithromycin. Complications Antigens that are currently available for DTH skin testing are not associated with significant morbidity and do not cause mortality. Experimental animal models of immunodeficiency with absent DTH reactivity suggest that other infections may also occur in the absence of effective CMI. These infections include  L monocytogenes, L pneumophila, T gondii,  and  Leishmania  species. In humans with idiopathic disseminated BCG or with mutations in the IFN-γ signaling pathway, the risk of contracting nontyphus  Salmonella  infections increases. One report describes severe infections with viruses (eg,  respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] ,  parainfluenza virus ,  herpes simplex virus (HSV) , cytomegalovirus [CMV], and  varicella-zoster virus [VZV] ) in a patient with an IFN-γ signaling pathway defect. Some patients with  IFNGR1  mutations have good antibody responses to HSV, CMV, VZV, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) without clinical infection, suggesting that their host response to these viruses is intact. Prognosis Adequate nourishment and discontinuation of drug therapy can reverse anergy caused by malnutrition and immunosuppression by immunomodulating agents, respectively. As noted in Mortality/Morbidity, severe mutations in  IFNGR1 ,  IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P40,  and  IL12RB1  lead to lethal disseminated infections with NTM. Mutations in the IFN-γ signaling pathway that cause milder clinical infections are described; many of these patients benefit from exogenous IFN-γ therapy. Patient Education   Regarding  IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P40,  and  IL12RB1  mutations, inform families about the risks of infection so that appropriate steps to avoid exposure to infection are instituted. Families should be aware that BCG and live viral vaccines are contraindicated. Genetic counseling is an essential as a part of medical care for the family. Inform parents of the 1 out of 4 risk for affected infants in autosomal recessive gene mutations. Mutations in the intracytoplasmic domain of  IFNGR1  result in autosomal dominant transmission. If hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is considered as a therapeutic option, an adequate informed consent from for HSCT must include the high risk for life-threatening infection during the preparative immunosuppressive regimen in addition to the risk for failure to engraft and  graft versus host disease (GVHD) . Although successful complete immune reconstitution from HSCT can be obtained using fully HLA matched related and unrelated donors, patients may not engraft or may experience GVHD post-transplant. Other forms of stem cell reconstitution that can be offered include cord blood cell transplantation. Gene therapy is expected to be an option in the future. The  Immune Deficiency Foundation  is an important resource for education and for support for patients and families with any primary immunodeficiency disease. The current address is 40 W. Chesapeake Ave, Suite 308, Towson, MD 21204. Some states have local chapters. The  Jeffrey Modell Foundation  at 747 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017 provides support and raises funds. For excellent patient education resources, visit eMedicineHealth's  Allergies Center . Differential Diagnoses Diagnostic Considerations Consider primary T-cell immunodeficiency, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), when anergy is present. Other well-recognized primary immunodeficiency diseases with anergy include  Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ,  DiGeorge syndrome , ataxia telangiectasia, and other  chromosomal breakage disorders . Exclude  malnutrition , overwhelming infection, and immunosuppression with corticosteroids and other drugs. Certain malignancies, such as Hodgkin disease, are associated with anergy. Consider rheumatologic disease, especially  systemic lupus erythematosus  and  sarcoidosis  as a cause of anergy in specific clinical situations. Also consider temporary immunosuppression following MMR vaccination (< 3 wk) in young infants Mutations that effect responses to interferon (IFN)-γ or its production include  IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT-1, IL12P4,  and  IL12RB1 . As a result, these patients may manifest altered (often excessive) DTH skin test reactivity. In patients with autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome caused by STAT3 mutation or DOCK8 deficiency, DTH responses may be attenuated due to impaired Th17 cell development. B-Cell and T-Cell Combined Disorders Chromosomal Breakage Syndromes DiGeorge Syndrome Hodgkin Lymphoma Measles Pediatric HIV Infection Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Tuberculosis Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Medication Medication Summary PPD, which has been used to evaluate exposure to  M tuberculosis,  and  Candida  Ag are the only currently available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Ags for delayed—type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing. The most clinically informative Ags used for DTH responses are  Candida  and tetanus Ags, because most individuals are exposed to these Ags as infants. By age 9-12 months, more than 80% of immunocompetent children mount positive responses to these Ags. Previously available DTH Ags that were withdrawn from clinical use include the Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) multitest, coccidioidin, mumps, and histoplasmin. Mumps Ag is a relatively poor Ag in eliciting a positive DTH reactivity. Studies have shown only 60% of previously mumps infected adults to have a positive DTH reactivity. An even lower response is predicted when the only exposure to mumps is by MMR immunization. Tuberculin tests Class Summary These agents are used to detect infection with  M tuberculosis. Tuberculin, purified protein derivative (PPD Mantoux test, Aplisol, Tubersol) The standard skin test uses 5 U of PPD in a volume of 0.1 mL. A lower concentration of 1 U/0.1 mL is used when a high exposure to antigen, as in caseating tuberculosis, is suspected; 250 U can be used if standard test result is negative and person is known to be immunocompromised. A negative DTH reaction does not rule out infection but may indicate disseminated infection as in miliary tuberculosis.  Tetanus antigens Class Summary These are used to assess cell mediated immunity (CMI) following the primary series of diphtheria-tetanus-a cellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine (3 doses). Conventionally, it has also been used as a control for tuberculin testing in patients who are immunocompromised or suspected to have disseminated tuberculosis.  Tetanus toxoid adsorbed or fluid The standard TD vaccine is diluted to 1:100 or 1:10. A positive DTH reaction indicates recognition by cell-mediated immunity; protection correlates with antibody responses.  Candida antigens Class Summary Most infants have been exposed to  Candida  antigen (Ag) even without clinical thrush or  Candida  diaper dermatitis. Japanese studies showed that 80% of children had positive DTH responses by age 1 year; therefore,  Candida  is a conventional Ag used as a positive control for tuberculin skin testing in individuals who are immunocompromised or when disseminated tuberculosis is suspected.  Candida skin test antigen (Candin, NDC#38697-200-1; Allermed) Also known as Dermatophytin. It is diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with sterile water. ",

				"body": "Overview Background Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a potentially life-threatening dermatologic disorder characterized by widespread erythema, necrosis, and bullous detachment of the epidermis and mucous membranes, resulting in exfoliation and possible sepsis and/or death (see the image below). Mucous membrane involvement can result in gastrointestinal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, ocular abnormalities, and genitourinary complications. Diffuse maculopapular rash in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  Diffuse maculopapular rash in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  TEN is most commonly drug induced. However, the disorder has other potential etiologies, including infection, malignancy, and vaccinations (see Etiology). TEN is idiosyncratic, and its occurrence is not easily predicted. Some authors believe that  Stevens-Johnson syndrome  (SJS; also known as erythema multiforme major) is a manifestation of the same process involved in TEN, with the latter involving more extensive necrotic epidermal detachment. TEN involves more than 30% of the body surface, whereas SJS involves less than 10% (see Differentials). A classification system, based largely on the extent of epidermal detachment and morphology of the skin lesions, aids in differentiating opposite spectrums of the same disease entity. [ 1]  This system comprises the following: TEN with spots TEN without spots Overlap Stevens-Johnson syndrome and TEN (SJS-TEN) TEN with spots is defined as widespread, irregularly shaped erythematous or purpuric macules with blistering that occurs on all or part of the macule. Blisters become more confluent and result in detachment of the epidermis and erosions on greater than 30% of the body surface area. Mucosal surfaces are usually involved. TEN without spots is defined as widespread, large areas of erythema with no discrete lesions. Epidermal detachment is greater than 10% of the body surface area. Mucosal surfaces are usually involved. Overlap Stevens-Johnson syndrome and TEN (SJS-TEN) is characterized by widespread, irregularly shaped erythematous or purpuric macules with blistering that occurs on all or part of the macule. Blisters become confluent and result in detachment of the epidermis and erosions on 10-29% of the body surface area. TEN is a clinical diagnosis, confirmed by histopathologic analysis of lesional skin (see Clinical and Workup). The mainstay of treatment is supportive care until the epithelium regenerates. Early transfer of patients to a burn or intensive care unit has been shown to reduce the risk of infection, mortality rate, and length of hospitalization (see Treatment). Historical background Alan Lyell provided an early description of TEN in 1956, describing the condition as \"an eruption resembling scalding of the skin.\" [ 2]  This dermatologic condition is characterized by extensive epidermal loss suggestive of severe scalding. In that same year, Lang and Walker reported a case of TEN. [ 3]  The disorder was originally described by Debre et al in 1939 in French as  l'erythrodermie bulleuses avec epidermolyse. [ 4]  Lyell later reclassified the conditions of 2 of his patients as having staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, [ 5]  which is due to  Staphylococcus aureus  infection rather than to a probable drug hypersensitivity-type reaction. Histopathologic analysis of the skin remains the main tool for discrimination between the two conditions. Patient education Patients who have had TEN must be counseled regarding the likely causative medication or agent, and they must be advised to avoid these medications and those of the same or similar classes in the future. Cross-reactivity may occur with agents that chemically resemble the causative agent. Patients must call a pharmacist whenever they start a new prescription. Genetic factors are suspected in drug-induced blistering disorders, and blood relatives of the patient also should not use the suspected drug. For patient education information, see the  Skin, Hair, and Nails Center , as well as  Life-Threatening Skin Rashes . Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of TEN has not been fully elucidated; however, various theories have received wide acceptance. TEN is believed to be an immune-related cytotoxic reaction aimed at destroying keratinocytes that express a foreign antigen. TEN mimics a hypersensitivity reaction, with its characteristic delayed reaction to an initial exposure and an increasingly rapid reaction with repeated exposure. The widespread epidermolysis and blistering of TEN results from keratinocyte apoptosis—an organized series of biochemical reactions leading to cell changes and cell death. [ 6]  However, the number of inflammatory T cells in the skin of patients with TEN is variable and perhaps too low to explain the widespread destruction. [ 7]  There is evidence supporting several immunopathologic pathways leading to keratinocyte apoptosis in TEN, including the following: Fas ligand activation on keratinocyte membranes leading to death receptor–mediated apoptosis [ 8]  Release of destructive proteins (perforin and granzyme B) from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated from an interaction with cells expressing major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I [ 9]  Overproduction of T cell– and/or macrophage-derived cytokines (interferon-γ [INF-γ], tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], and various interleukins) [ 10,  11]  Drug-induced secretion of granulysin from CTLs, natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells [ 12]  Precisely how the inciting agent triggers the proposed pathways is yet to be elucidated. Etiology TEN can be induced by drugs or infection or can be idiopathic. Medications are the major precipitating cause. Numerous medications have been implicated, [ 13]  including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ampicillin, allopurinol, corticosteroids (topical and systemic), and the antiretroviral drugs nevirapine and abacavir. [ 14,  15]  Antibacterial drugs associated with TEN include the following: Sulfonamides (4.5 cases per million users per week) Chloramphenicol Macrolides (eg, erythromycin) Penicillins Quinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin, [ 16]  trovafloxacin [ 17]  ) Anticonvulsants associated with TEN include the following: Phenobarbital Phenytoin [ 18]  Carbamazepine Valproic acid Lamotrigine TEN in patients taking anticonvulsants has most often been reported within 2 months of starting the drug. However, some cases associated with long-term use have been reported. NSAIDs associated with TEN include the following: Phenylbutazone and oxybutazone - Implicated most commonly, although they are no longer available in the United States Oxicams (eg, piroxicam, tenoxicam) - Implicated more often than other NSAIDs Ibuprofen Indomethacin Sulindac Tolmetin With allopurinol, risk is not constant over time. Patients have a 5.5 relative risk. However, during the first 2 months of therapy, the relative risk is 52, and the long-term therapy risk is 0.5. No laboratory test is able to confirm a specific drug etiology. A causal link is suggested when TEN occurs during the first 4 weeks of medication therapy, usually between 1 and 3 weeks. Drugs with longer half-lives and those with circulating active metabolites may result in more fulminant disease. Infectious agents (ie,  Mycoplasma pneumoniae , herpes virus, hepatitis A), immunizations, and bone marrow or solid organ transplantation have also been associated with TEN. Epidemiology In the United States, the annual frequency of TEN is reported to be 0.22-1.23 cases per 100,000 population. In the HIV-positive population, the incidence of TEN increases to 1 case per thousand per year. [ 19]  Worldwide, the average annual incidence of TEN is 0.4-1.3 cases per million population. [ 20]  In 1992, the cumulative incidence of TEN and SJS in Germany was 1.9 cases per million population. A French survey of dermatologists and health care facilities reported an annual incidence of 1 case per million population. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics A genetic predilection toward carbamazepine-induced TEN has been observed in HLA-B*1502–positive Han Chinese patients. [ 21]  The US Food and Drug Administration recommends screening for the HLA-B*1502 allele before initiating carbamazepine in patients of Asian ancestry. [ 22]  For unclear reasons, TEN appears to have a predilection for females. The female-to-male ratio is 1.5:1. [ 23]  TEN may occur in all age groups; however, the mean age of patients with TEN is reported to be between 46 and 63 years. Infection is more commonly implicated as an etiology in children, whereas medication exposure is more common in adults. Elderly persons may be at greater risk because of their tendency to use multiple medications. Prognosis The estimated mortality associated with TEN varies widely in different reports, from 10-70%. Outcome depends in part on the quality of care and the rapidity with which treatment is initiated. Septicemia and multisystem organ failure are the primary causes of death. Epithelial loss results in vulnerability to bacterial and fungal infections. Sloughing of stratified epithelium of mucosal membranes can result in GI hemorrhage, respiratory failure, ocular abnormalities, and genitourinary lesions. Significant fluid loss from extensive skin exfoliation and an inability to tolerate oral intake can lead to hypovolemia, acute tubular necrosis, and shock. Age, extent of epidermal involvement, and serum urea level are said to be the most important prognostic factors in TEN. [ 24]  Mortality rates in children are much lower than in adults. [ 25]  Elderly patients have a poor prognosis. Other negative prognostic factors include the following: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels Respiratory failure Multiple drugs Thrombocytopenia Lymphopenia Neutropenia Leukopenia Sepsis Severity-of-illness score A severity-of-illness score that estimates the risk of death in TEN (SCORTEN) has been developed and validated. [ 26]  Each of the following independent prognostic factors is given a score of 1: Age >40 years Heart rate >120 beats per minute Cancer or hematologic malignancy Involved body surface area >10% Blood urea nitrogen level >10 mmol/L (28 mg/dL) Serum bicarbonate level < 20 mmol/L (20 mEq/L) Blood glucose level >14 mmol/L (252 mg/dL) The number of positive criteria and the corresponding mortality rates are as follows: 0: 1 to 3% 2: 12% 3: 35% 4: 58% 5 or more: 90% Sequelae Major sequelae are generally limited to the affected organ systems (ie, the skin and mucosal membranes). Cutaneous sequelae of TEN include the following: Changes in skin pigment (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation; sun exposure must be avoided for several months because ultraviolet light can worsen hyperpigmentation; sunblock is recommended) Nail loss and nail dystrophy Hypohidrosis (inability to sweat) Scarring, alopecia, and hypertrophic scarring Dermal desiccation, causing deep dermal wounds Chronic xerostomia Esophageal strictures Vulvovaginal synechiae Phimosis Chronic erosion of the mouth and genitalia Ocular complications generally result from abnormal keratinization of the tarsal conjunctiva. A Sjogrenlike syndrome with decreased lacrimal secretion causes dry eye and predisposes to corneal abrasions and corneal scarring with neovascularization. In addition, patients have been reported to have palpebral synechiae, entropion, or symblepharon (adhesion of the eyelids). [ 27]  A study by Power and colleagues found that 50% of patients with TEN developed ocular complications. [ 28]  Patients treated with steroids fared no better than those treated without steroids. Therefore, TEN remains a common cause of visual loss in a significant number of patients. Ultimately, 5-9% of patients can become blind as a result of some of these complications. Clinical Presentation History Patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may describe an influenzalike prodrome characterized by the following: Malaise Rash Fever Cough Arthralgia Myalgia Rhinitis Headache Anorexia Nausea and vomiting, with or without diarrhea Other prodromal signs and symptoms include conjunctivitis (32%), pharyngitis (25%), and pruritus (28%). The prodrome typically lasts from 1 day to as long as 3 weeks. The cutaneous eruption begins as a poorly defined, erythematous macular rash with purpuric centers. Over a period of hours to days, the rash coalesces to form flaccid blisters and sheetlike epidermal detachment. The lesions predominate on the torso and face, sparing the scalp. Pain at the site of the skin lesions is often the predominating symptom and is often out of proportion to physical findings in early disease. Mucous membrane erosions (seen in 90% of cases) generally precede the skin lesions by 1-3 days. The most frequently affected mucosal membrane is the oropharynx, followed by the eyes and genitalia. Oral cavity involvement typically presents as a sore or burning sensation. Intake may be limited because of pain associated with the oropharyngeal lesions. Ocular manifestations range from acute conjunctivitis to corneal erosions and ulcers. Genital involvement may result in painful urination. Other mucosal surfaces such as the esophagus, intestinal tract, or respiratory epithelium may be affected. Bronchial epithelial sloughing may result in dyspnea and hypoxemia. Most cases of TEN are drug induced, typically occurring within 1-3 weeks of therapy initiation and rarely occurring after more than 8 weeks. Therefore, a detailed medication history, focusing on medications that have been recently started, is a vital component of the patient's history. More than 220 different medications have been suggested. The most commonly implicated agents include the following: Sulfonamide antibiotics Antiepileptic drugs Oxicam nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Allopurinol Nevirapine Abacavir Lamotrigine Fewer than 5% of patients report no history of medication use. Physical Examination Vital signs in toxic epidermal necrolysis may include hyperpyrexia, hypotension secondary to hypovolemia, and tachycardia. Skin examination Skin lesions begin as painful/burning, warm, erythematous, morbilliform macules that are initially discrete. They begin symmetrically on the face and thorax before spreading to the entire body. The skin lesions coalesce and fill with fluid-producing large, flaccid blisters. The epidermis sloughs in sheets, leaving a characteristic moist, denuded dermis (see images below). Conjunctivitis and denudation and erosions of other mucous membranes precede epidermal necrolysis. Epidermal sloughing in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  Epidermal sloughing in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) ulcer in great toe (initial infection).  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) ulcer in great toe (initial infection).  A positive Nikolsky sign is evident when the application of slight lateral pressure to the epidermal surface results in the epidermis easily separating from its underlying surface. The usual course is an intense erythema that progresses rapidly to epidermolysis and stops within 2-3 days. Dermatologic recovery typically takes 1-3 weeks, with mucosal lesions taking longer. Rarely, necrolysis recurs in areas that began to heal. Involvement of the oral mucosa results in edema and erythema, followed by blistering. Ruptured blisters may form extensive hemorrhagic erosions with grayish white pseudomembranes or shallow aphthouslike ulcers. Hemorrhagic crusting of the lips is a common finding (as seen in the image below). Hemorrhagic crusting of mucous membranes in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  Hemorrhagic crusting of mucous membranes in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  Ocular involvement varies in severity and can result in mild inflammation, conjunctival erosion, purulent exudates, or pseudomembrane formation. Involvement of respiratory epithelium may result in bronchial hypersecretion, hypoxemia, interstitial infiltrates, pulmonary edema, bacterial pneumonia, or bronchiolitis obliterans. Complications Numerous complications of TEN can arise as a result of the widespread cutaneous and mucosal membrane inflammation and necrosis. Stomatitis and mucositis, which are painful and hinder oral intake, can place patients at risk for dehydration and malnutrition. Epithelial loss predisposes to septicemia ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,  gram-negative species, and  Candida albicans ). Renal hypoperfusion, acute tubular necrosis, and renal insufficiency may develop subsequent to septic shock. Ulceration of various mucosal membranes may result in pain, scarring, and stricture formation. Affected surfaces include oral, ocular, and urogenital mucosa. Barrera and colleagues reported a case of hypopharyngeal stenosis and dysphagia with recurrent aspiration. [ 29]  Miscellaneous complications include hypovolemia, massive gut bleeding, and pulmonary emboli. Mild-to-severe eye complications can occur, such as the following: Lid edema Persistent dry eyes Chronic photosensitivity Conjunctivitis Keratitis Conjunctival fornix foreshortening Ectropion  or  entropion  with subsequent  trichiasis Symblepharon Corneal ulceration and scarring Blindness Pulmonary complications may occur. Mucous retention and sloughing of tracheobronchial mucosa may occur, with aspiration of mucosal debris. Pneumonia and pneumonitis are common and sometimes fatal complications of TEN. Pulmonary embolism and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have also been reported. GI hemorrhage results from intestinal inflammation. Workup Approach Considerations TEN is a clinical diagnosis, confirmed by histopathologic analysis of lesional skin. Early involvement of a dermatologist and dermatopathologist is recommended. Skin biopsy, harvested at the earliest possible stage, is important in establishing an accurate diagnosis and directing specific therapeutic modalities. Necrotic keratinocytes with full-thickness epithelial necrosis and detachment is consistent with the diagnosis of TEN. Perivascular and scattered lymphocytic infiltration of the dermis is sometimes demonstrated, although the underlying dermis is not greatly altered. No definitive or specific emergent laboratory tests are indicated for TEN. Basic laboratory tests may be helpful in planning symptomatic or supportive therapy. Surveillance cultures of blood, skin, and urine should be obtained. Imaging studies are not indicated for the diagnosis of TEN. Chest radiography should be performed in the setting of respiratory distress because tracheobronchial inflammation may predispose to diffuse interstitial pulmonary disease or pneumonia. Blood Studies Hematology studies include the following: Complete blood count (CBC) and differential Circulating immune complexes Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Leukopenia is common, whether a result of TEN itself or of bacteremia, as is a normochromic normocytic anemia. Eosinophilia may be present. Less often, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and bandemia may occur. Neutropenia is an unfavorable prognostic sign. In the acute phase, there are transient decreases of peripheral CD4 +  T lymphocytes and reduced allogeneic and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, which returns to normal in 7-10 days. Coagulation studies may include prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time. Chemistry to assess fluid and electrolyte losses include the following: Albumin Blood urea nitrogen Total protein As toxic epidermal necrolysis progresses, multiple organs are affected, causing other abnormalities in laboratory test results. Diffuse skin involvement may cause significant fluid loss and electrolyte abnormalities. Biopsy A skin biopsy specimen must be obtained. In experienced hands, a frozen section specimen expedites matters. Results are very useful in differentiating TEN from other dermatologic disorders. Histologically, TEN is characterized by full-thickness epidermal necrosis with little evidence of epidermal or dermal inflammation. Epidermal detachment and sloughing may be evident. Satellite cell necrosis may be visible early, progressing to extensive eosinophilic necrosis. Treatment & Management Approach Considerations Management of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) requires prompt recognition of the disorder and withdrawal of all potential causative agents. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care until the epithelium regenerates. Supportive measures include isolation, fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional support, pain management, and protective dressings. Early transfer of patients to a burn or intensive care unit has been shown to reduce the risk of infection, mortality rate, and length of hospitalization. Withdraw the offending agent, if one is identified, as soon as possible. One observational study showed a reduction in mortality from 26% to 5% when the implicated drugs with short elimination half-lives were withdrawn no later than the day the blisters or erosions first developed. No controlled prospective treatment studies or generally accepted guidelines exist. In 1991, Avakian and colleagues published the University of Florida treatment protocol for toxic epidermal necrolysis. [ 31]  In 2007, these guidelines were revised by Fromowitz and colleagues. [ 32]  The guidelines are as follows: Monitor fluids and electrolytes. Administer fluids and titrate based on central venous pressure and urine output; on average, 3-4 L are needed in patients with 50% of the body surface area affected. Parenteral nutrition or nutrition provided enterally via a soft-fine bore nasogastric tube is usually needed. Start total parenteral nutrition in patients unable to take nourishment. Early and continuous enteral nutrition reduces the risk of stress ulcers, reduces bacterial translocation and enterogenic infection, and allows earlier discontinuation of venous lines. Prehospital Care Prehospital care for patients with TEN is similar to that for patients with burns. Supplement with oxygen by face-mask as needed; do not perform prophylactic tracheal intubation. Prevent hypothermia with rewarming devices and blankets. In severe TEN, the barrier function of the skin is compromised. Thus, contamination and evaporation must be minimized. The patient should be treated similarly to one with extensive burns, that is, with the application of sterile coverings. Fluid and pulmonary status must be carefully monitored. Emergency Department Care For the emergency physician, the two most important elements in the treatment of TEN are discontinuation of the offending drug and admission to a burn unit. [ 33]  Evidence suggests that rapid institution of these two measures is associated with a more favorable prognosis. [ 34,  35]  Emergency department care should be directed toward the following: Maintaining fluid and electrolyte homeostasis Mitigating temperature loss Providing adequate analgesia Preventing secondary infection Aggressive fluid and electrolyte management, pain control, and meticulous skin care are important. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids should follow standard guidelines used for burn patients. However, patients with TEN typically require less aggressive fluid replacement than that of burn patients because of less severe microvascular injury. A goal of resuscitation should be to maintain sufficient mean arterial blood pressure (ABP >65 mm Hg), central venous pressure (CVP 8-12 mm Hg), and central oxygenation (Svco 2  >70%) for adequate tissue perfusion and renal perfusion. [ 23]  Fluid management should be based on the physiologic endpoint of urine output of 0.5-1 mL/kg/h. [ 33]  Patients with extensive skin involvement require reverse isolation and a sterile environment. Areas of skin erosion should be covered with nonadherent protective dressings such as petrolatum gauze. Respiratory distress may result from mucosal sloughing and edema and may necessitate endotracheal intubation and ventilation. Supportive Systemic Therapy The patient should be placed in a heated environment to enhance reepithelialization. However, this may enhance water losses, and appropriate hydration must be maintained. Institute a bed warmer. Saline applied to skin hourly is important, and then emollients are smeared. Chlorhexidine solution is used to bathe the patient's skin. Chlorhexidine mouthwash is administered 4 times a day, and white petrolatum is administered to the lips. Rinse the patient’s mouth frequently and apply a topical anesthetic or spray for buccal pain. Provide daily physical therapy for range-of-motion exercises. Place a Foley catheter and nasogastric tube only when needed. Energy requirements for patients with TEN must be carefully calculated and nutritional support provided. Protein loss can be significant. [ 25]  Patients with mucosal vulnerability may have severe bleeding complications. Coagulation factors and blood counts should be held within the normal ranges, and transfusion of red cells, platelets, and plasma products should be considered when necessary. [ 23]  Ocular complications are common and can be debilitating. Early consultation with an ophthalmologist is recommended to assess and minimize the risk of ocular damage. Treatments with topical lubricants/antibiotics and steroid drops are often needed. Wound care Meticulous wound care is necessary to prevent secondary infection. Debate continues in the literature regarding whether or not to debride the wounds associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis. To date, no conclusive evidence supports early, late, or no debridement of the wounds. Cutaneous lesions heal in approximately 2 weeks; mucosal membrane lesions take longer. If debridement of necrotic and desquamation areas is chosen, it is performed with the patient under general anesthesia. Apply porcine xenografts to involved areas. Provide hydrotherapy (whirlpool) twice a day. Repair and replace porcine xenografts. Apply Kerlix dressings soaked in silver nitrate 0.5% to involved areas after each whirlpool session. Pharmacologic therapies Emergence of resistance precludes the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Bacterial sampling of skin lesions should be performed the first day and every 48 hours. Indicators for antibiotic treatment include increased number of bacteria cultured from the skin with selection of a single strain, sudden decrease in temperature, or deterioration of the patient's condition. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should include broad-spectrum antimicrobials that cover gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic organisms.  Staphylococcus aureus  is the main bacteria present during the first days, with gram-negative strains appearing later. If staphylococcal infection is involved, administer an appropriate antistaphylococcal agent (ie, nafcillin/oxacillin for methicillin-sensitive organisms or vancomycin for methicillin-resistant organisms). Provide pain relief with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Opiate analgesics for skin pain and anxiety are essential for comforting patients. Hydroxyzine may be used to relieve the intense pruritus that may occur when reepithelialization begins. Patients remain nonambulatory until skin begins to heal. Until that time, anticoagulant therapy is imperative. Heparin is indicated for prophylaxis of thromboembolic events. Apply chloramphenicol ointment to prevent infection. Silver sulfadiazine should be avoided because it is a sulfonamide derivative and may precipitate TEN. Silver compounds not utilizing sulfadiazine or other sulfa medications should be used because they assist in wound healing and prevent infection and bacterial growth. No specific treatment modality has been proven effective, including the following: Plasmapheresis Corticosteroids Cyclophosphamide Cyclosporine Tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) [ 6,  36]  Multiple studies of these modalities have been completed, and multiple studies are ongoing. Completed studies have shown that either the risk of the medication outweighs the benefit or the data are inconclusive to support its utilization. Therefore, there is a significant need for randomized control studies to further evaluate potential treatment modalities in TEN. Corticosteroids are commonly used to control progression of TEN, but this is highly controversial. In some studies, corticosteroids have increased the incidence of mortality. Consider the use of plasmapheresis, if available, daily for 3 days. Although prospective randomized studies have not been performed, limited data suggest that plasmapheresis may enhance elimination of the drug or offending agent or inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and should be considered. [ 37]  Anti–TNF-α treatment has been reported to rapidly resolve skin lesions due to TEN. TNF-α is strongly expressed in keratinocytes and macrophages of lesional skin, and high concentrations are found in cutaneous blister fluid. Sucrose-depleted IVIg 1 g/kg/d (infused over 4 h) for 3 days may be beneficial if started within 48-72 hours of bulla onset. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since the onset of bulla but TEN is still actively progressing, with new lesions, IVIg may still be useful. Consultations Most patients with TEN require specialized care under the direction of a team of physicians with experience in handling this disorder. Burn-unit care represents an option worthy of serious consideration. Required consultations may include the following: A dermatologist is consulted to identify and to confirm the diagnosis of TEN A plastic surgeon is consulted to debride areas of skin necrosis, as indicated An ophthalmologist is consulted for assisting in the treatment of ocular manifestations and preventing long-term sequelae An internal medicine specialist is consulted to assist in patient treatment Consultation with a respiratory medicine specialist may be important, since respiratory mucosa may slough; establishment of pulmonary toilet may be advisable Otolaryngologic or urologic consultation may be helpful in patients with significant mucous membrane involvement of those areas. Differential Diagnoses Diagnostic Considerations Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and  Stevens-Johnson syndrome  (SJS) are considered to be a single disease entity differing in severity. There is debate whether TEN and SJS are part of a spectrum of disorders including  erythema multiforme major  (EMM); however, it is widely accepted that SJS and TEN are distinct entities differing in etiology, clinical manifestations, histopathology, treatment, and prognosis. EMM is characterized by typical target lesions (at least 3 concentric rings) with or without blister formation in a symmetric, predominantly acral distribution. In contrast, the skin lesions of SJS and TEN are predominately central (trunk and face), consisting of blisters that arise on erythematous or purpuric macules and involve 2 or more mucosal surfaces. Histopathologic examination is necessary in differentiating these disorders from other severe bullous skin diseases, including the following [ 30]  : Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Toxic shock syndrome Phototoxic skin reactions Drug reaction with eosinophilia Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Paraneoplastic pemphigus TEN and SJS are characterized by apoptotic keratinocyte cell death in the epidermis with dermal-epidermal separation that results in bullae formation. Other problems to be considered in the differential diagnosis of TEN include the following: Cauterization burns Caustic agents Drug reaction with eosinophilia Generalized bullous fixed eruption Kerosene and paraffin burns Acute Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye) Chemical Burns Exfoliative Dermatitis Hypersensitivity Vasculitis Pemphigus Vulgaris Pseudoporphyria Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) Toxic Shock Syndrome Medication Medication Summary The goals of pharmacotherapy in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are to reduce morbidity and to prevent complications. No specific treatment modality has been proven effective, but agents such as crystalloids, antibiotics, antihistamines, anticoagulants, analgesics, and antiseptic agents are important for supportive care. Use of corticosteroids is controversial. Crystalloids Class Summary Fluid resuscitation is critical in TEN. In cases of acute skin failure, insensible losses may be enormous, and repletion of water loss is essential.  Isotonic sodium chloride 0.9% Patients with TEN are at serious risk of dehydration, which may complicate their condition. For example, water losses in a hypercatabolic state result in hypoalbuminemia and reduced renal perfusion. This leads to acute renal failure; therefore, maintaining intravascular volume is paramount. The rate of intravenous repletion should be titrated based on urine output or central venous pressure.  Antibiotics Class Summary Patients with TEN lose their epidermis, a major barrier to invading organisms. If patients become infected, morbidity is enhanced.  Staphylococcus aureus  is the main bacterium present during the first days, with gram-negative strains appearing later. Case reports of  Klebsiella  species, [ 38]  Escherichia coli , and  Pseudomonas  species recovered from patients with TEN have created concern about the possible polymicrobial nature of sepsis associated with this condition. Therefore, good gram-negative coverage may be necessary. Nafcillin Nafcillin covers most common skin organisms (eg, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). If patient has allergy to penicillin or if methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) is present on skin culture, use vancomycin.  Gentamicin Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic for gram-negative coverage. It is used in combination with both an agent against gram-positive organisms and one that covers anaerobes. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime, and others with good gram-negative coverage are suitable alternatives. Adjust dose based on renal insufficiency.  Antihistamines Class Summary Hydroxyzine may be used when reepithelialization begins because intense pruritus may occur. Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) Hydroxyzine antagonizes H1 receptors in the periphery. It may suppress histamine activity in subcortical region of the central nervous system.  Anticoagulants Class Summary Heparin is indicated for prophylaxis of thromboembolic events. Patients with TEN remain nonambulatory until skin begins to heal, and until that time, anticoagulant therapy is imperative.  Heparin Heparin augments activity of antithrombin III and prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. It does not actively lyse thrombus but is able to inhibit further thrombogenesis. Heparin prevents reaccumulation of clot after spontaneous fibrinolysis. It is indicated for the prevention of thromboembolic events.  Analgesics Class Summary Opiate analgesics are important to alleviate pain and anxiety associated with TEN. Much like treatment of a second-degree burn, the pain must not be ignored.  Morphine sulfate (Duramorph, Astramorph, MS Contin) Morphine is the drug of choice for pain in patients with TEN. In case of allergy or intolerability, fentanyl may be used. Fentanyl Citrate ( Fentora, Abastral, Duragesic) A synthetic opioid analgesic that is primarily a mu receptor agonist, fentanyl is 50-100 times more potent than morphine. It has short duration of action (1-2 h) and minimal cardiovascular effects, such as hypotension. Respiratory depression is uncommon, but this effect lasts longer than its analgesic effect. Fentanyl is frequently used in patient-controlled analgesia for relief of pain. Unlike morphine, fentanyl is not commonly associated with histamine release.  Antiseptics Class Summary These agents inhibit growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Chlorhexidine gluconate (PerioGard, Peridex, Hibiclens, Avagard) Chlorhexidine binds to negatively charged bacterial cell walls and extramicrobial complexes. It has bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects.  Topical Anesthetics Class Summary Topical anesthetics can be applied to mucous membranes, especially buccal, to relieve pain. Benzocaine (Americaine, Anbesol, Chiggerex Plus) Benzocaine inhibits neuronal membrane depolarization, blocking nerve impulses. It provides oral or mucosal anesthesia, thereby controlling pain.  Corticosteroids Class Summary While corticosteroids may be used, their use is highly controversial. Although high-dose corticosteroids used early in the course of TEN (within 24-48 hours of onset) may halt the progression of the reaction, many experts believe that corticosteroids should not be used because they predispose patients to infection, mask early signs of sepsis, encourage GI bleeding, and impair or delay wound healing.  If corticosteroids are used, the initial high dose is titrated down as quickly as possible and tapered off, usually over 7-10 days.  Dexamethasone (Baycadron) Dexamethasone decreases inflammation by suppressing migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reducing capillary permeability. Other corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, prednisone, and hydrocortisone, also may be used.  Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol, Medrol, A-Methapred) Methylprednisolone is a highly potent synthetic glucocorticoid that causes diverse metabolic effects and modifies the body's immune responses to various stimuli.  Prednisone Prednisone, a synthetic glucocorticoid analog, acts as a potent immunosuppressant. It May inhibit cyclooxygenase, which, in turn, inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. These effects may result in analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities.  Hydrocortisone (A-Hydrocort, Solu-Cortef, Cortef) Hydrocortisone elicits anti-inflammatory properties and causes profound and varied metabolic effects. This agent modifies the body's immune response to diverse stimuli.  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) ulcer in great toe (initial infection).

				"body": "Overview HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a syndrome that occurs in HIV-infected patients who are being treated with antiretroviral medications. Although the term HIV-associated lipodystrophy refers to abnormal central fat accumulation (lipohypertrophy) and localized loss of fat tissue (lipoatrophy), some patients have only lipohypertrophy, some have only lipoatrophy, and, less commonly, a subset of patients exhibits a mixed clinical presentation. Because no uniform morphologic changes occur with HIV lipodystrophy, lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy are considered distinct entities, with different risk factors and metabolic processes underlying their development. This article addresses both lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy, with a focus on the morphologic changes and underlying pathophysiology of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Note the image below. Facial HIV-associated lipodystrophy in a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.  Facial HIV-associated lipodystrophy in a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.  Lipohypertrophy in this syndrome is characterized by the presence of an enlarged dorsocervical fat pad, circumferential expansion of the neck, breast enlargement, and abdominal visceral fat accumulation. Lipoatrophy is exemplified by peripheral fat wasting with loss of subcutaneous tissue in the face, arms, legs, and buttocks. Lipodystrophy can be disfiguring cosmetically. Involvement of the face is most common and carries a social stigma that may reduce the quality of life of patients with HIV disease and may pose a barrier to treatment and reduce medical adherence. [ 1,  2]  The incidence of diabetes mellitus or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is increased secondary to hyperglycemia (from insulin resistance) or hyperlipidemia, respectively. Other features of HIV lipodystrophy syndrome include hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. Consequently, patients with HIV lipodystrophy syndrome are at increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. The following Medscape articles address other forms of lipodystrophy: Dermatologic Manifestations of Generalized Lipodystrophy Acquired Partial Lipodystrophy Progressive Lipodystrophy Dermatologic Manifestations of Localized Lipodystrophy The following Medscape Resource Centers may be helpful as well: HIV Pathogenesis Resource Center HIV Transmission & Prevention Resource Center For other discussions on management of HIV infection, see  HIV Disease ,  Pediatric HIV Infection , and  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . For patient education information, see the  Sexually Transmitted Diseases Center ,  Cholesterol Center , and  Statins Center , as well as  HIV/AIDS ,  High Cholesterol ,  Cholesterol FAQs , and  Atorvastatin (Lipitor) . Pathophysiology Although the precise mechanisms underlying HIV lipodystrophy are not well understood, several hypotheses based on in vitro and human studies may explain the pathogenesis of the lipid changes that take place. Most experts currently believe that HIV type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), especially stavudine and zidovudine, are implicated. [ 3,  4,  5,  6,  7]  Genetic factors in the patient may confer particular susceptibility. [ 8,  9]  In addition, immunohistochemical components may play a role in the process of lipodystrophy in HIV patients. [ 10]  One mechanism in which PIs function is by down-regulating PPAR-gamma and C/EBP-alpha, which are key adipogenic transcription factors. Once these factors are down-regulated, there is an interruption with lipogenesis and adipocyte maturation. In addition, they create a large production of reactive oxygen species, which leads to the production of cytokines, macrophage recruitment, and inhibition of glucose transport 4 (GLUT-4), along with a deficiency in insulin signaling and the hormones leptin and adiponectin. [ 11]  If adiponectin is replaced, studies have shown decreased PI toxicity. [ 12]   PIs have also been shown to activate endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways by depleting the calcium in adipocytes. In addition, they also interfere with the expression of regulator genes,  CHOP ,  ATF4 , and  XBP , which further alters lipid metabolism and autophagy. [ 11]  PIs also have a high affinity for the catalytic site of HIV-1 protease, which shares a 60% sequence homology with 2 proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cytoplasmic retinoic acid–binding protein type 1 (CRABP-1), and low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein (LDLR-RP). Inhibition of CRABP-1 impairs the production of retinoic acid, leading to decreased fat storage and adipocyte apoptosis, with the subsequent release of lipids into the circulation. Inhibition of LDLR-RP results in hyperlipidemia secondary to the failure of hepatic and endothelial removal of chylomicrons and triglycerides from the circulation. NRTIs inhibit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to mtDNA depletion, respiratory chain dysfunction, and reduced energy production, which, in turn, causes insulin resistance and secondary dyslipidemia. [ 13,  14]  Interestingly, mtDNA is depleted only at normal oxygen levels; hypoxic adipocytes do not take up triglycerides and are resistant to mtDNA-induced damage, except after treatment with NRTIs. [ 15]  Some PIs, particularly ritonavir, inhibit cytochrome P450 3A, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. Ritonavir has also been shown to cause an extreme amount of apoptosis. On the other hand, atazanavir has been shown to cause apoptosis and autophagy. The PIs saquinavir, ritonavir, and nelfinavir directly inhibit the development of adipocytes from stem cells and increase the metabolic destruction of fat in existing adipocytes. Taking genetics into account, a missense mutation in the resistin gene has been shown to have an association with hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and limb fat loss when combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). [ 11]  Other studies have shown that resistin can function as a useful biomarker for peripheral adipose tissue loss and may be the future of therapeutic strategies. [ 16]  A 2016 study done on rats has shown that PIs reduce the activity of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), which is an HDL-bound esterase that inhibits the decomposing lipid peroxidation products, which further inhibits atherosclerosis. Therefore, there is a higher risk of atherosclerosis and a greater chance of experiencing lipodystrophy. [ 17]  In observation of immunohistochemical components, a 2014 cross-analytical study analyzed the cytokine expression from adipose tissue obtained in biopsies in 19 HIV patients experiencing lipodystrophy. As a result, tissue necrosis factor (TNF)–alpha and caspase-3 were more prominent in men than in women. In addition, the patients with lipodystrophy had less TNF-beta when being compared with the control group. Lastly, the group of individuals that experienced longer exposure to HIV and HAART had a positive association with levels of TNF-alpha. [ 10]  As shown, sex differences lead toward different pathophysiologic outcomes, but more so, the elevation in cytokine production elevates the likelihood of developing lipodystrophy in HIV patients. In another 2014 study focused on HIV patients with lipodystrophy, 21% of women and 37% of men were found to have growth hormone deficiencies (GHDs). Men who had GHD had higher amounts of visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and trunk fat. Women who had GHD had significantly lower insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Overall, adipose tissue distribution accounts for growth hormone sex differences; those with deficiencies have more problems with lipodystrophy. [ 18]  Evidence also suggests decreased insulin sensitivity and beta-cell dysfunction in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. [ 19]  Additionally, researchers have found that estrogen receptor expression is down-regulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of these patients. This is due to the effects of HAART regimens that include PIs. Stavudine has been particularly implicated in the apoptosis of adipocytes, affecting both dividing and differentiating cells. [ 20,  21]  In addition, HIV-1 may cause dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy in the absence of HAART, via impaired cholesterol efflux from macrophages and increased tumor necrosis factor–alpha, which modulates free fatty acid metabolism and lipid oxidation and attenuates insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis. [ 13,  22]   Tumor necrosis factor‒like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a multifocal cytokine that is decreased in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. [ 23]  A 2006 study in HIV-positive patients on HAART found that resting energy expenditure and lipid oxidation were significantly higher in those with lipodystrophy than in those without lipodystrophy. [ 24]    More recent research has found an association with genetic variants in plasma levels, specifically an increased RBP4 and a decreased level of omenti in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. [ 25]  Associations with circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are also increased. [ 26]  Further studies are needed to examine how these updated associations can be incorporated in advancing treatments and early detection of lipodystrophy. Etiology Part of the early difficulty in establishing the risk factors for HIV-associated lipodystrophy has been agreement on a case definition. Fat accumulation and lipoatrophy are clinically distinct and appear to have separate risk factors. Because most patients are taking a regimen of combined antiretroviral medications, identifying a specific class of antiretroviral associated with lipodystrophy has proved difficult. Despite this, the most common culprits of HIV-associated lipodystrophy appear to be those regimens containing PIs and thymidine analogue NRTIs. Lipodystrophy associated with PIs occurs 2-12 months after starting PI therapy. Previous reports have shown that ritonavir-saquinavir combinations have a stronger association with abnormal fat accumulation than indinavir or nelfinavir. One study revealed that switching from other PIs to nelfinavir led to an improvement in lipodystrophy symptoms. The association between ritonavir and hypertriglyceridemia is stronger than that with other PIs. An increased risk of lipodystrophy is reported with the addition of NRTIs (eg, stavudine) to PI treatment compared with treatment with only PIs. Of the NRTIs, the thymidine analogues stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (ZDV, previously known as AZT) are mostly directly implicated in lipodystrophy, particularly lipoatrophy; switching to a different NRTI such as tenofovir or abacavir can produce demonstrable increases in limb fat and can improve lipid profiles. [ 27,  28]  In children with HIV, both thymidine analogue NRTIs and PIs are implicated in the development of lipodystrophy. [ 29]  Lipodystrophy has been reported in individuals with HIV infection who have never been treated with PIs; possible mechanisms are noted in Pathophysiology. Other reported risk factors associated with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy are as follows: Duration of antiretroviral therapy Female sex Higher body fat at onset of HAART Higher triglyceride levels Other reported risk factors associated with HIV-associated lipoatrophy are as follows: Therapy with thymidine analogue NRTIs (eg, stavudine, zidovudine) Lower pretreatment body mass index at onset of HAART Longer duration of HIV infection White race Other reported risk factors associated with both lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy are as follows [ 30]  : Duration of HAART therapy Older age Low CD4 count Epidemiology United States statistics Wide variation exists in the literature regarding the prevalence of HIV lipodystrophy. Various studies show the prevalence rate of this syndrome is 2-60% in all patients who are HIV positive [ 31,  32]  ; a 2007 meta-analysis found a prevalence rate of 14-40% in HIV-positive patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). [ 33]  In untreated patients with HIV infection, a 4% prevalence rate is reported. The incidence of associated new-onset hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia is 24%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. International statistics Rates of HIV-associated lipodystrophy vary according to country. [ 6,  34,  35]  A prospective cohort study in England demonstrated a 17% prevalence rate after an 18-month follow-up. Variations in the reported prevalence rates are related to a variety of many factors, including age, genetics, HIV medications, and case definition. In 2014, among all people living with HIV worldwide, the prevalence of lipodystrophy ranges from 10-80%. [ 36]  Racial, sexual, and age-related differences in incidence The risk of lipoatrophy is higher in whites (5.4 odds ratio) than in blacks. Women are at a higher risk of lipodystrophy than men (1.9 relative risk). Women are more likely to report fat accumulation in the abdomen and breasts and hypertriglyceridemia, whereas men are more likely to describe fat depletion from the face and extremities, along with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. [ 37]  Increasing age is a risk factor in the development of this syndrome. Over the last 12 years, the prevalence of lipodystrophy in HIV-infected men has decreased, yet the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk has increased. [ 38]  Prognosis HIV-associated lipodystrophy progressively worsens as PI therapy is continued, and the discontinuation of PI therapy may result in regression. [ 39]  To the authors’ knowledge, no studies have been conducted to determine the morbidity and mortality from the body morphologic changes of HIV-associated lipodystrophy per se. However, the insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. The incidences of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are increased secondary to hyperglycemia (from insulin resistance) and hyperlipidemia, respectively. Osteopenia of the lumbar spine may be present in patients with increased visceral fat accumulation. Dorsocervical fat pad accumulation may result in neck pain and sleep apnea. Clinical Presentation HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a progressive disease; its severity is directly proportional to age, duration of disease, and length of protease inhibitor (PI) and/or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment. On physical examination, abnormal fat accumulation (lipohypertrophy) findings are as follows: The dorsocervical fat pad (commonly called \"buffalo hump\") becomes variably enlarged [ 40,  41,  42]  The circumference of the neck expands by 5-10 cm Breast hypertrophy occurs Central truncal adiposity results from abdominal visceral fat accumulation (\"Crix belly\" [referring to Crixivan, the trade name for indinavir, a PI] or \"protease paunch\") Symmetric and asymmetric lipomatoses may occur; a rare pattern of lipoaccumulation involving bandlike lipomatosis tissue symmetrically from the breasts, laterally to the axillae, has been reported [ 43]  Suprapubic fat pads (pubic lipomas) occur in nearly 10% of patients with lipodystrophy [ 44]  The development of multiple angiolipomas is associated with PI therapy [ 45]  Lipoatrophy findings are as follows: Temporal wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat from the cheeks (buccal fat pad) produces an emaciated appearance with prominent nasolabial creases (see image below) Facial HIV-associated lipodystrophy in a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.  Facial HIV-associated lipodystrophy in a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.  Subcutaneous tissue is depleted from the arms, shoulders, thighs, and buttocks (peripheral wasting), with prominence of the superficial veins in these sites Differential Diagnostic considerations Other problems to be considered in patients with lipodystrophy are as follows: Seip-Berardinelli syndrome Lawrence syndrome Dunnigan syndrome Kobberling syndrome Barraquer-Simons syndrome Abdominal carcinoma Malnutrition Other problems to be considered in patients with lipohypertrophy are as follows: Cushing disease Glucocorticoid therapy Scleredema of diabetes mellitus Launois-Bensaude syndrome Other problems to be considered in patients with lipoatrophy are as follows: HIV wasting syndrome [ 46]  Localized lipodystrophy Malnutrition Anorexia nervosa Hyperthyroidism Cancer cachexia Severe chronic infection Adrenal insufficiency Differentials Generalized Lipodystrophy Acquired Partial Lipodystrophy Progressive Lipodystrophy Localized Lipodystrophy Workup HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a clinical diagnosis. Although there is not a specific clinical protocol to make the diagnosis, advancements have been made that can aid in the assessment of lipodystrophy. A 2014 cross-sectional European study showed that anthropometric ratios (fat-mass ratio, waist-to-thigh ratio, waist-to-calf ratio, and arm-to-trunk ratio) are useful in making the diagnosis of lipodystrophy. Incorporating this method can lead to an accurate and earlier diagnosis. [ 47]  The only relevant laboratory studies are serum lipid assays. A skin or subcutaneous fat biopsy is not routinely performed to make a diagnosis of HIV lipodystrophy. Imaging studies are not generally necessary in the workup of HIV lipodystrophy. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning, CT scanning, and MRI are limited to research studies to objectively quantify fat abnormalities. [ 48]  MRI demonstrates the accumulation of visceral fat in the abdomen compared with subcutaneous fat. CT scanning demonstrates abnormal fat proliferation throughout the abdomen in a perivisceral distribution and little subcutaneous fat. Intra-abdominal organs are normal, and no ascites is seen. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry may demonstrate lumbar spine bone density reduction in association with increased visceral fat accumulation. [ 49]  Lipid panel Because abnormal glucose and/or lipid metabolism may accompany HIV lipodystrophy, checking the lipid panel and assessing for glucose intolerance is important prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy. Some experts suggest checking these values again at 6 months and then, if the results are normal, yearly. Hyperlipidemia findings are as follows: Fasting cholesterol level – Greater than 200 mg/dL Fasting triglyceride level - Greater than 150 mg/dL Increased apolipoprotein c-III and apolipoprotein E levels Hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia findings are as follows: Diabetes - Fasting plasma glucose level of greater than 126 mg/dL or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of greater than 200 mg/dL Impaired fasting glucose - Fasting plasma glucose level of 100-125 mg/dL Impaired glucose tolerance - Two-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140-199 mg/dL Treatment & Management Lipodystrophy is often progressive and, in limited cases, may regress after the withdrawal of PI therapy. Withdrawal of thymidine analogues (eg, switching from protease inhibitors to  efavirenz ) has shown to be effective for reversing lipoatrophy. [ 29,  50]  Treatment of the underlying metabolic derangements of glucose and lipid metabolism is necessary. The evaluation and management of glucose intolerance, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia are discussed elsewhere (see  Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ,  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ,  Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia , and  Hypertriglyceridemia ). Tesamorelin , a growth hormone–releasing factor analog, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy in November 2010. Approval was based on 2 studies that showed that visceral adipose tissue was significantly decreased from baseline at 26 weeks and sustained at 52 weeks. [ 51,  52,  53]  These were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies in 816 HIV-infected patients with excess abdominal fat associated with lipodystrophy. In 2015, the FDA approved metreleptin, a synthetic leptin analog for the treatment of non-HIV lipodystrophy. [ 54]  Currently, clinical trials are pending for the use of metreleptin in patients with HIV lipodystrophy. For the treatment of hyperlipidemia, fibrates and/or statins, as well as  dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA) alone, improve the lipid profile. [ 55]  For treatment of hyperglycemia,  metformin , [ 56]  insulinlike growth factor–1, [ 57,  58]  and DHEA improve glycemic control. Studies of thiazolidinedione treatment for HIV lipodystrophy have yielded conflicting results. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated positive effects of  rosiglitazone  on lipoatrophy, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic indices [ 59]  ; another randomized, controlled trial of rosiglitazone did not show a benefit for lipoatrophy or metabolic parameters. [ 60]  A meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled trials found that  pioglitazone  therapy was more effective than placebo for increasing limb fat mass in HIV lipoatrophy, but rosiglitazone was not significantly more effective. [ 61]  A meta-analysis of 16 trials concluded that rosiglitazone should not be used in HIV-associated lipodystrophy; that pioglitazone may be safer, but any benefits appear small; and that metformin was the only insulin-sensitizer to demonstrate beneficial effects on insulin resistance, lipids, and body fat redistribution. [ 62]  An improvement in lipohypertrophy and/or lipoatrophy in individuals treated with human growth hormone, [ 63,  64]  anabolic steroids, naltrexone, and a combination of DHEA and a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor (eg, ( indomethacin  100 mg/day,  naprosyn  1000 mg/day) has been reported in some cases. Lastly, a case report has shown that the use of oral contraceptive pills worsens hypertriglyceridemia; therefore, this is not the recommended method of birth control while dealing with lipodystrophy. [ 65]  Surgical procedures for lipodystrophy A variety of plastic surgery procedures have been studied for the treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. [ 66]  For lipohypertrophy, the effects of treatment with liposuction or lipectomy are variable, and recurrence is common. Fat harvested during liposuction of the dorsocervical fat pad can be used for autologous fat transfer to facial areas exhibiting lipoatrophy. [ 67]  Facial fat grafting is further addressed in  Facial Fat Grafting . Additional treatment for lipohypertrophy, classically the buffalo hump, can be accomplished with adipocitolitic aqueous microgelatinous solution. [ 68]  For lipoatrophy, free flaps, lipotransfer, or commercial fillers or implants can be used to replace adipose tissue.  Poly-L-lactic acid  (Sculptra) has been used as a semipermanent injectable filler in these patients. [ 69]  Sculptra is approved by the FDA for the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in HIV-positive patients. In addition, the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been proven to benefit those patients experiencing lipoatrophy. Individuals who experience the benefits of PMMA have improved quality of life and body image, which has been shown to aid in reducing depression and increasing the compliance of antiretroviral therapy. [ 70,  71]  Calcium hydroxylapatite  (Radiesse) is a soft-tissue filler consisting of 30% calcium hydroxylapatite microspheres and 30% carboxylmethylcellulose. It is also FDA-approved for the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in HIV-positive patients. A 5-year study has also shown that a polyacrylamide hydrogel‒based filler is a safe and effective treatment for facial wasting. [ 72]  Other filler options include injectable bovine and human collagens, hyaluronic acid, [ 73,  74]  and autologous free fat transfer. See  Soft Tissue Implants  for more information. Rare cases of persistent granulomatous inflammatory reactions to some fillers have been reported [ 75]  ; thus, patients undergoing such treatment should understand possible risks. Diet and activity No specific dietary regimen is used in the management of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Adequate nutrition and exercise may result in modest improvement in lipodystrophy and improve central obesity. A balanced low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet is preferable when hypertriglyceridemia is present. [ 76]  Exercise has been proven to improve insulin sensitivity. One study showed that progressive resistance training with an aerobic component may reduce trunk fat mass. [ 77]  Physical activity has also been shown to yield metabolic improvements and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. [ 78]  Consultations Dermatologist consultation can be useful for an evaluation of the underlying causes of lipodystrophy and for consideration of surgical options. Plastic surgeons also may be considered for fillers, fat transfers, and liposuction. Internal medicine or endocrinology specialist consultations help for an evaluation of the underlying causes of lipodystrophy and for the management of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. Infectious diseases specialist consultation is useful for the management of HIV infection. Psychiatrist or psychologist consultation may be necessary because of the psychological impact of body shape changes. Long-term monitoring Follow-up laboratory testing should include assessments of the following: Viral load and/or CD4+ T-cell counts to evaluate HIV-disease progression Fasting lipid profile to evaluate hyperlipidemia Fasting blood glucose and/or glucose tolerance test to evaluate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance Patients should receive follow-up care every 3-6 months, and the aforementioned laboratory examinations should be performed as necessary. Patients with HIV lipodystrophy may report feelings of anxiety, depression, loss of self-esteem, poor body image, and social and sexual dysfunction. It is important to ask about these issues and consider referral to a psychiatrist when appropriate. Facial HIV-associated lipodystrophy in a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.

				"body": "Overview Renal disease is a relatively common complication in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. [ 1,  2]  HIV nephropathy can result from direct kidney infection with HIV or from the adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs (see the image below). [ 3,  4,  5,  6]  Further, patients with HIV disease are at risk for developing prerenal azotemia due to volume depletion resulting from salt wasting, poor nutrition, nausea, or vomiting. Types of electrolyte abnormalities observed with some of the drugs used to treat opportunistic... Types of electrolyte abnormalities observed with some of the drugs used to treat opportunistic infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ARF stands for acute renal failure.  HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), formerly known as AIDS-associated nephropathy, is characterized by the following findings: Nephrotic range proteinuria Azotemia Normal to large kidneys on ultrasound images Normal pressure Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on renal biopsy findings Although FSGS is the predominant glomerular lesion in HIVAN, other reported glomerular lesions in patients with HIV include IgA nephropathy, cryoglobulinemia, amyloidosis, and a lupuslike immune complex glomerulopathy. [ 7]  In the preantiretroviral therapy era, HIVAN was characterized by rapid progression to renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leading to the need for dialysis. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the natural course of this disease, increasing the importance of prompt diagnosis and proper care. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration should be obtained and renal function monitored during HAART. [ 8]  Physicians must consider HIVAN in patients who develop proteinuria. For other discussions on management of HIV infection, see  HIV Disease ,  Pediatric HIV Infection , and  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . For patient education information, see the  Immune System Center  and  Sexually Transmitted Diseases Center , as well as  HIV/AIDS  and  Rapid Oral HIV Test . Epidemiology According to the US Renal Data System (USRDS), HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) accounts for approximately 1% of new end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases in the United States. HIVAN is observed in patients regardless of the route by which HIV was contracted. HIVAN is observed predominantly among African Americans and is the third leading cause of ESRD among blacks aged 20-64 years. [ 9,  10]  Most patients with HIVAN are young black men, and approximately 50% of patients with HIVAN are intravenous drug abusers. [ 11,  12]  Overall, HIVAN is observed more often in men than in women, with a male-to-female ratio of 10:1. The mean age of persons with HIVAN is 33 years. HIVAN may occur in children. [ 13]  Pathophysiology Experiments using transgenic mice have provided perhaps the strongest evidence for a direct role by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in the development of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Researchers created transgenic mice by inserting HIV DNA constructs into the mice's genomes. The mice developed proteinuria and had a histologic picture similar to that observed in patients with HIVAN. A genetic or environmental cofactor that has not yet been identified is required for patients to develop this disease. This unidentified factor might explain the predilection for HIVAN among black persons. [ 9]  The cellular target in the development of HIVAN is probably the renal glomerular and tubular epithelium. Using in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction assays to detect HIV-1 DNA and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), investigators have shown that renal glomerular and tubular epithelial cells are productively infected by HIV-1 in patients with HIVAN; this argues strongly for localized replication of HIV-1 in the kidney and for the existence of a renal viral reservoir. Further, circularized viral DNA, a marker of recent nuclear import of full-length, reverse-transcribed RNA, has been detected in kidney biopsy samples from patients with HIVAN, suggesting active replication in renal tissue. [ 14]  However, the mechanisms of virus-induced renal injury remain undetermined. Peculiar histopathologic features of HIVAN are the enhanced proliferation and the loss of differentiation markers of glomerular epithelial cells. In one study, HIV-1 infection was shown to kill renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro by triggering an apoptotic pathway involving caspase activation and Fas up-regulation, suggesting that apoptosis of nonlymphoid cells can be directly induced by HIV-1. The net and long-standing glomerular and tubular epithelial cell damage leads to proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial scarring. The role of cytokines has not been established, and although their presence is not essential for the development of HIVAN, cytokines may modify the progression of infection or a patient's susceptibility to infection. The levels of cytokines are increased in renal biopsy samples from patients with HIVAN. In one study, mesangial and tubular cell production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor–alpha was shown to be a potent stimulus for HIV-1 expression in HIV-1–infected monocytes. [ 15]  Viral replication in response to cytokines may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIVAN. Genetics The reason behind the increased predilection among black persons for the development of HIV-associated nephropathy is not clear. [ 9]  In general, black persons have a higher incidence of other renal diseases (eg, diabetic nephropathy, lupus); therefore, they may have an underlying genetic predisposition to severe renal disease, regardless of the etiology. The type of host response to the HIV infection itself may be what determines whether or not nephropathy develops in a specific individual. Kopp et al studied genetic variants predisposing to idiopathic and HIV-1–associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and they concluded that genetic variation at the  MYH9  locus substantially explains the increased burden of FSGS and hypertensive kidney disease among African Americans. They carried out admixture-mapping linkage-disequilibrium genome scanning on 190 African American individuals with FSGS and 222 controls and identified a chromosome-22 region centered on  MYH9 , a functional candidate gene expressed in kidney podocytes. [ 16]  Prognosis In one study, the rate of progression from the initial presentation to ESRD was 2.5 months in the pre-HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) era. With the introduction of HAART in 1996-1997, the traditional natural history of rapid progression of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) has been slowed significantly. HAART has been shown to retard the progression of renal disease in persons with HIVAN, and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be beneficial. Among patients with HIV infection and end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis, survival has improved significantly compared with the uniformly dismal outcomes in the 1980s. [ 17]  Clinical Presentation Patients with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) typically present with a  nephrotic syndrome  consisting of nephrotic-range proteinuria (>3.5 g/d), azotemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Edema is uncommon in HIVAN, yet many authors think that this is a characteristic of HIVAN. The salt-losing propensity and high oncotic pressure contributed by marked hypergammaglobulinemia in these patients have been suggested as possible explanations for this puzzling observation. CD4+ T-cell count The CD4 +  T-cell count in patients with HIVAN is usually depressed below 200 cells/µL, but HIVAN has been reported in patients with higher CD4 counts. The prognosis for renal survival is worse in patients with AIDS, especially if their CD4 count is less than 50 cells/µL. [ 18]  Ultrasound and CT scan Patients with HIVAN are not typically hypertensive, even in the face of renal insufficiency, and their kidneys are usually normal to large in size and highly echogenic on ultrasonograms, as well as on CT scans. This may result from prominent interstitial expansion by cellular infiltrate and markedly dilated tubules containing voluminous casts. Urinalysis Routine urinalysis may occasionally reveal findings of nonnephrotic proteinuria in patients being evaluated for other medical conditions. The urinalysis reveals microhematuria, leukocytes, hyaline casts, and oval fat bodies, but no cellular casts. Serum complement levels are normal. SIADH Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, may be observed in patients with HIVAN and may reflect an increase in total body water (from nephrotic syndrome or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [SIADH]) or from hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, respectively. SIADH may result from concomitant pulmonary infection or from persistent nausea from medications or gastrointestinal disease. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a cause of type IV renal tubular acidosis manifesting as hyperkalemia with normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, is much more common when renal insufficiency is present. Renal Biopsy The decision to obtain a biopsy sample is somewhat controversial in the general medical community. Even if a patient presents with the classic clinical features of HIV-associated neuropathy (HIVAN), clinical consideration is predictive of the biopsy diagnosis in only 55-60% of patients. Therefore, to distinguish HIVAN from other forms of renal disease (eg, immune complex glomerulonephritis, immunoglobulin-A nephropathy), patients who are seropositive for HIV require a renal biopsy. The typical practice is to obtain a renal biopsy specimen if the patient's daily protein excretion is greater than 1 g. Histology Findings from light microscopy of kidney biopsy tissue are diagnostic in most cases. The most common histologic light microscopy finding is a collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. [ 19]  The glomerular capillary tuft is collapsed (see the first image below) and may be segmentally or globally sclerosed. Visceral epithelial cells are hypertrophied and form a characteristic pseudocrescent in the Bowman space. Tubulointerstitial scarring, atrophy, and marked dilatation of the tubules (microcystic dilatations) are usually present (see the second image below). Light microscopy with trichrome staining showing the collapse of the glomerular tuft, with...

The renal tubules are dilated and filled with proteinaceous material.  Light microscopy showing prominent microcystic dilatation of renal tubules filled with... Light microscopy showing prominent microcystic dilatation of renal tubules filled with proteinaceous material; this finding is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–associated nephropathy, although it may also be observed in chronic glomerulonephritis.  Immunofluorescent microscopy helps to identify positive staining for albumin and immunoglobulin G in epithelial cells and for immunoglobulin M, C3, and, occasionally, A in mesangial or sclerotic areas. Electron microscopy reveals wrinkling of the basement membranes, epithelial cell proliferation, and focal foot process effacement. Tubuloreticular structures in the glomerular endothelial cells (consisting of ribonucleoprotein and membrane, the synthesis of which is stimulated by alpha interferon) is highly predictive of HIVAN (see the image below). Electron microscopy showing a segment of the glomerular basement membrane; foot process... Electron microscopy showing a segment of the glomerular basement membrane; foot process effacement (black arrow) and prominent tubuloreticular inclusions (red arrow) are present.  Antiretroviral Drugs and Renal Function Most HIV medications are well tolerated, even in the presence of renal insufficiency [ 20]  . The (potential) toxicity of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (ie, zidovudine, [ 21]  didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, emtricitabine) uniformly manifests as type-B lactic acidosis. However, didanosine may cause electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperuricemia, and stavudine may cause hyperuricemia. Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with known renal toxicity and hypophosphatemia, and therefore, dose adjustment is indicated when creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL/min. Except for nevirapine, which may cause lactic acidosis, the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (ie, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine) have no reported significant renal toxicity. As a class, the protease inhibitors (PIs) (ie, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, darunavir) may precipitate nephrolithiasis. A classic form of this is indinavir crystalluria, which occurs independently of renal function; however, the stones resolve after cessation of indinavir therapy. A study by Rockwood et al found that the rate of kidney stones was 7.3 per 1000 patient-years in patients receiving ritonavir-boosted atazanavir compared with 1.9 per 1000 patient years in patients receiving other commonly used antivirals. [ 22]  Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is the first of a newer class of fusion inhibitors that targets the gp41 protein on the surface of HIV and stops the virus from entering cells. Enfuvirtide has no known renal effects for creatinine clearance of greater than 35 mL/min. Maraviroc (Selzentry), approved in August 2007, is also a fusion inhibitor. It blocks the CCR5 coreceptor on CD4+ cells, preventing the virus from entering. Maraviroc does not require dose adjustment for creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min. Raltegravir (Isentress) is the first of a newer class of integrase strand transfer inhibitors. It does not require dose adjustment in patients with abnormal renal function. Dose adjustment should be made in patients receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 50 mL/min. Patients receiving nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may also receive a dose adjustment when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 50 mL/min. No dose adjustment is required for patients taking protease inhibitors. Some drugs used to treat opportunistic infections in HIV disease may also cause nephrotoxicity or electrolyte abnormalities (see the image below). Types of electrolyte abnormalities observed with some of the drugs used to treat opportunistic... Types of electrolyte abnormalities observed with some of the drugs used to treat opportunistic infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ARF stands for acute renal failure.  Pharmacologic Therapy Although there are no guiding clinical studies, some experts recommend consideration of therapy in all patients with HIV-associated nephritis (HIVAN). Initiation or adjustment of antiretroviral therapy may be indicated. See  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection  for specific information, including recommendations for dosage adjustments for renal insufficiency. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and corticosteroids have been studied for use in HIVAN. Some reports on pediatric populations suggest that  cyclosporine  can be effective in reducing proteinuria in persons with HIVAN. The usefulness of cyclosporine therapy for HIVAN warrants further study. Researchers are pursuing several promising therapeutic strategies. Patients who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require dialysis and consideration of renal transplantation in carefully selected cases. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors In patients with advanced renal insufficiency,  captopril  was noted to improve renal survival for a mean length of 37-156 days. [ 23]  In a subsequent prospective follow-up of 44 patients, the median length of renal survival for patients who received  fosinopril  was 479.5 days, with only 1 patient developing ESRD. All untreated control subjects progressed to ESRD, with a median length of renal survival of 146.5 days. [ 24]  The exact mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors in HIVAN is unknown, but it may be related to a hemodynamic effect, a reduction in the transglomerular passage of serum proteins, and an antiproliferative effect mediated in part by the inhibition of transforming growth factor beta. Use ACE inhibitors if patients do not have hyperkalemia. Corticosteroids A number of case reports have suggested that corticosteroids offer some short-term benefit in HIVAN. [ 25]  In one report, results from a pretreatment and posttreatment kidney biopsy suggested that an improvement in renal function was associated with a reduced number of lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrating the interstitium. In another report, of 20 patients who were treated with  prednisone , 60 mg/day for 2-11 weeks, followed by a slow taper, [ 26]  8 patients required maintenance dialysis, 11 died from complications, and 7 were alive and no longer had ESRD after a follow-up of 44 weeks. Experimental therapeutic strategies Animal research shows promising results for retarding renal disease progression in HIVAN. In one study, the use of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor decreased visceral epithelial cell proliferation in HIV-infected mice. [ 27]  In another study, blocking nuclear factor kappa beta (a cell signaling pathway) in mice resulted in increased lifespan and kidney and lean body mass preservation. [ 28]  These benefits were associated with a reduction in the number of CD45 +  cells infiltrating the kidneys, amelioration of the renal architecture, and a reduction in the level of circulating inflammatory cytokines. Further studies are needed to determine the role of these inhibitors on human HIVAN. End-Stage Renal Disease The care of patients with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains a clinical challenge. Physicians must anticipate progressive renal disease in patients with HIVAN and plan the placement of an arteriovenous fistula in a timely manner for future use in hemodialysis. In current practice, hemodialysis is the accepted modality of ESRD therapy in these patients. A study by Ifudu et al showed that during a 68-month observation period, 17 (50%) of 34 patients with HIV infection and ESRD died, compared with 65 (50%) of 131 patients with ESRD alone. [ 29]  Mean survival was equivalent between patients with both HIV infection and ESRD and those with ESRD alone (47.4 mo and 50.2 mo, respectively). Because of increased susceptibility to infections, peritoneal dialysis has not been widely advocated. Similarly, immunosuppression after kidney transplantation is thought to pose a substantive risk of opportunistic infections in patients with HIVAN. [ 30]  Consequently, kidney transplantation in these patients is performed with caution in compliant, stable patients with no prior opportunistic infections who have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 +  T-cell count of more than 300 cells/µL. Anecdotal reports drawn from small samples of this selected group of patients with HIVAN suggest no extra risk of opportunistic infections. Until larger studies are performed, however, transplantation in persons with HIVAN should be focused on stable patients. In one study, 1- and 2-year actuarial patient survival was 85% and 82%, respectively, and graft survival was 75% and 71%, respectively. Plasma HIV-1 RNA remained undetectable, and CD4 counts remained in excess of 400 cells/µL with no evidence of AIDS for up to 2 years. These results were comparable to other high-risk populations receiving kidney transplantation. In a prospective study of kidney transplantation in 150 HIV-infected patients, Stock et al reported 1- and 3-year graft survival rates of 90.4% and 73.7%, respectively. The rejection rate was higher than expected, however, with 1- and 3-year estimates of 31% and 41%, respectively. Living-donor transplants were protective. Before transplantation, all patients had CD4 counts of at least 200/µL and undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels while being treated with a stable antiretroviral regimen, and HIV remained well controlled after transplantation. [ 31]  In an analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, Locke et al evaluated 39,501 patients undergoing renal transplantation between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2006 and found no difference in patient survival among HIV-positive patients versus HIV-negative patients (95.4% vs 96.2%, respectively). [ 17]  However, death-censored 1-year graft survival was significantly lower among HIV-positive patients (87.9% vs 94.6%). Locke et al concluded that with proper donor selection and transplant recipient management, including the avoidance of prolonged cold ischemic time, use of living donors, and determination of optimal immunosuppression dosing before transplant, long-term graft survival comparable to that in HIV-negative patients can be achieved.

				"body": "Overview The reduction in mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is regarded as one of the most effective public health initiatives in the United States. In the absence of treatment, the risk of vertical transmission of HIV is as high as 25-30%. With the implementation of HIV testing, counseling, antiretroviral medication, delivery by cesarean section prior to onset of labor, and discouraging breastfeeding, the mother-to-infant transmission has decreased to less than 2% in the United States.  Before the current treatment era, approximately 2000 babies were infected with HIV each year in the United States alone. Despite increasing HIV prevalence, that figure now stands at approximately 300 infants per year. [ 1]  The rapid clinical implementation of research findings directed toward decreasing perinatal transmission is credited as the key to this accomplishment. In 1994, the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocol 076 demonstrated that the administration of  zidovudine  during pregnancy and labor and then to the newborn decreased the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV by 68%, from 25.5% to 8.3%. [ 2]  In the late 1990s, the combined use of 3 or more antiretroviral medications was found to be highly successful at suppressing viral replication.  The exact mechanism of mother-to-child transmission of HIV remains unknown. Transmission may occur during intrauterine life, delivery, or breastfeeding. The greatest risk factor for vertical transmission is thought to be advanced maternal disease, likely due to a high maternal HIV viral load. [ 3]  Unfortunately, about 30% of pregnant women are not tested for HIV during pregnancy, and another 15-20% receive no or minimal prenatal care, thereby allowing for potential newborn transmission. [ 4]  Epidemiology United States statistics Early in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, women were rarely diagnosed with HIV or AIDS, but by 2005, women represented 27% of the estimated 45,669 new diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, with the greatest rise among young women. [ 5]  About 80% of new cases in women in the United States are contracted through heterosexual intercourse, 20% by contaminated needles, and most of the remaining cases by maternal-child transmission. Testing of donated blood has essentially eliminated blood transfusions as a source of infection.  Of women with AIDS, 71% were diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 44, implying that many of them may have been infected as adolescents. In the United States, African American and Hispanic women represent 25% of the female population but account for 82% of the total number of women with AIDS. Furthermore, women of color account for 80% of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases. [ 6]  International statistics The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has estimated that, in 2008, approximately 33.4 million people worldwide (1% of the global adult population aged 15-49 y) were infected with HIV, a decline from 2006 (39.5 million reported at that time); 67% of all people living with HIV worldwide live in sub-Saharan Africa, and 91% of all new infections among children occur there. [ 7]  More than 500,000 babies worldwide contract HIV from their mothers; 90% of these cases occur in developing countries. In 2005, AIDS claimed an estimated 2.4-3.3 million lives; more than 500,000 of which were children. One third of these deaths were in sub-Saharan Africa. [ 5]  Prophylaxis and Pregnancy Outcome The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, where clinicians should report cases of exposure to antiviral therapy in pregnancy, contains approximately 5,000 reported exposures and notes no increase in the congenital malformation rate with exposure to antiretroviral medications, even in the first trimester, with the exception of efavirenz. Early exposure to efavirenz has been associated with neural tube defects.  Concern was raised that antiretroviral therapy may increase the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several studies have shown that zidovudine monotherapy had no negative effect on pregnancy.  Although data from cohorts in the United States have not shown an increased risk of preterm birth with combination therapy, a European collaborative study showed an increased risk of preterm labor in women infected with HIV who were taking combination antiretroviral therapy, with an odds ratio for preterm birth of 1.8 for combination therapy without a protease inhibitor and 2.6 for combination therapy that included a protease inhibitor. [ 8]  In a US study of pregnant women infected with HIV, the overall rate of adverse pregnancy outcome, including prematurity, low birth weight, stillbirth, and abnormal Apgar scores, was similar in women who received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and those who did not. [ 9]  Of the 2123 women in the study, 1590 received monotherapy, 396 received combination therapy without a protease inhibitor, and 137 received combination therapy with a protease inhibitor; 1143 did not receive antiretroviral therapy.  Rates of prematurity and extreme prematurity did not differ significantly according to antiretroviral regimen. Although the risk of low and very low birth weight was greater in the group receiving a protease inhibitor, the results did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, this may be a reflection of higher viral load or advanced stage of disease rather than exposure to protease inhibitors. [ 9]  In a more recent retrospective study (2004-2012) that evaluated US infant growth patterns during their first year of life among those born to perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) (32 infants, 25 mothers) and nonperinatally HIV-infected (NPHIV) mothers (120 infants, 99 mothers) who received care, infants of PHIV mothers had lower mean length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) that were associated with birth length. Other small-for-gestational age anthropometric parameter associations included those of birth weight and weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) and those of both birth length and weight with weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ). The investigators also reported an association between delivery HIV RNA level below 400 copies/mL with increased WAZ and WLZ. [ 10]  A large meta-analysis that included articles from several countries between 1998 and 2006 showed that overall, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) did not increase the risk of prematurity; however, the use of regimens with protease inhibitors seemed to increase prematurity slightly. [ 11]  A possible association exists between HAART and preeclampsia. [ 12]  The development of glucose intolerance may be more common in pregnant women with HIV. Originally thought to be associated with protease inhibitors, gestational diabetes appears to be somewhat increased regardless of the medication regimen. As such, during pregnancy, women should be screened and monitored for glucose intolerance. [ 13]  HIV and Pregnancy Planning Preliminary data suggest that women with HIV may suffer from subfertility. Conception in couples who have never conceived may occur in a median of 6 months with 2 acts of intercourse during the ovulatory period of the cycle. With each act, the risk of sexual transmission must be considered even in the presence of an undetectable viral load. Conducting testing and considering reproductive techniques in women infected with HIV may be worthwhile in an effort to reduce the risk of infection to a healthy partner.  In couples planning a pregnancy where only the male partner is infected, natural conception carries a risk of sexual transmission to the uninfected female. Counseling provided to such couples should include strategies to minimize HIV transmission. Options include adoption, sperm donation, and  assisted reproduction techniques . While antiretroviral therapy can reduce viral load in the blood to undetectable levels, some reports have shown that men can still have a substantial viral concentration in semen in the presence of an undetectable plasma viral load.  When possible, confirmation of undetectable seminal plasma viral load may be considered. If HIV viral load cannot be suppressed, semen washing has been proposed and may decrease the HIV RNA and DNA to undetectable levels. After processing and rechecking for residual contamination, the spermatozoa can be used for intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization.  Pregnancy does not appear to influence the progression of HIV disease. [ 14,  15]  A large cohort of French women with known seroconversion dates noted a pregnancy-adjusted relative risk of progression from HIV to AIDS of 0.7. [ 16]  Furthermore, pregnancy does not seem to affect survival of women infected with HIV. [ 17]  For serodiscordant couples who want to conceive, the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for the HIV-infected partner, with the strength of the recommendation differing based on the CD4-cell count of the infected partner. Additionally, NIH guidelines include discussion regarding pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) studies in heterosexual couples. New recommendations regarding periconception administration of antiretroviral PrEP for HIV-uninfected partners may offer an additional tool to reduce the risk of sexual transmission. The guidelines include information on counseling, laboratory testing, and monitoring of individuals on PrEP and the importance of reporting uninfected women who become pregnant on PrEP to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. [ 18,  19,  20]  HIV-infection risk-reduction strategies in conjunction with relatively inexpensive fertility awareness methods (FAMs) may be useful for counseling HIV-serodiscordant couples who want to conceive. [ 21]  Such methods include use of accessible and highly sensitive, but poorly specific, strategies like the calendar method, basal body temperature measurements, and cervicovaginal mucus secretion features. Urinary luteinizing hormone testing has high specificity and cost with less sensensitivity. Timed condomless sex has low cost but necessitates understanding how to precisely predict the fertile period in a menstrual cycle. [ 21]  Patient Education Approximately 30% of women in the United States are not tested for HIV during pregnancy. Reasons for declining should be explored and patients counseled appropriately. Testing strategies also include reoffering screening in the third trimester to women who declined first-trimester screening or who are in high-risk groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine third-trimester screening in women with high-risk behaviors or who exhibit signs or symptoms of the disease. [ 4]  Clinicians who care for women with HIV need to provide family planning services and counseling regarding optimizing health status. This includes encouraging compliance to medication regimens, cessation of smoking, and updating immunizations.  Stressing the importance of taking their medication regularly to decrease the possibility of the development of antiretroviral drug resistance may encourage women to comply with therapy. Cigarette smoking, concurrent use of drugs (cocaine, heroin), and unprotected intercourse have been associated with increased risk of perinatal transmission. It is encouraging to note there has been a substantial reduction in substance use in the past 2 decades. [ 22]  In a retrospective study over a 23-year period (1990-2012) that evaluated data from two prospective cohort studies (Women and Infants Transmission Study, Surveillance Monitoring for Antiretroviral Therapy Toxicities Study), investigators noted a dramatic decrease in substance use among 5451 HIV-infected pregnant women (1990: 82%; 2012: 23%). There was a significant decline in use of each substance between 1990 and 2006, when it reached a plateau, which the investigators suggested may have been caused by an epidemiologic transition of the HIV epidemic among US women. [ 22]  Substance use was inversely associated with receiving antiretroviral therapy. Women with multiple pregnancies with substance use in their previous pregnancy were at higher risk of substance use in their next pregnancy. [ 22]  Unfortunately, 15% of women infected with HIV receive no or minimal prenatal care, and 20% do not initiate prenatal care until late in the third trimester. Women who are not treated during pregnancy should be treated with one of the appropriate intrapartum antiretroviral drug regimens.  Even in the absence of antepartum treatment, intrapartum and early neonatal prophylaxis can reduce the mother-to-child transmission risk. Women should be extensively counseled regarding the ability to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) prophylaxis or treatment. In women who are being treated with HAART and planning a pregnancy, the teratogenic potential of certain antiretroviral medications must be reviewed and effective contraception discussed. These medications should be stopped prior to planning a pregnancy.  History and Physical Examination History In pregnancy, the initial history should assess the status of the patient’s HIV disease (eg, CD4 +  T-cell count, viral load), the need for beginning or altering antiretroviral medication, and ways to reduce perinatal transmission. A careful review of the medical and surgical history, gynecologic history, high-risk habits, and previous obstetric history should be done at the first prenatal visit.  Physical examination During pregnancy, a complete physical examination must be performed. Knowledge of the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy, such as an enlarged thyroid gland and a systolic murmur, is important to differentiate from disease process. HIV infection can affect essentially all body systems.  Screening The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends routine HIV screening for women aged 19-64 years and targeted screening for at-risk women outside of this age reference. All pregnant women should have their HIV serostatus evaluated when they first present for prenatal care.  Women should have the right to refuse testing after being informed that HIV testing will be drawn as part of their routine prenatal panel. This opt-out approach to prenatal screening, as advocated by the Institute of Medicine, is associated with higher testing rates among pregnant women. However, several states have laws that prohibit this approach and mandate that patients sign consent forms for testing, known as the opt-in approach. [ 23]  ELISA The most common screening test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which looks for the presence of antibodies. If this test result is positive, the ELISA is repeated to eliminate laboratory error prior to proceeding to a confirmatory test by Western blot. The ELISA has 98% sensitivity. False-negative results may occur early in the disease, and false-positive results have been reported after certain vaccines. Repeat testing several months later usually confirms seronegativity in such cases. A positive test is sent for Western blot.  Western blot For the Western blot, specific viral proteins are separated by electrophoresis, and reaction of antibody to 3 proteins must occur for the test to be considered positive. Indeterminate results occur when 1 or 2 of the proteins are present. In low-risk populations, indeterminate results usually revert to negative over several months. Western blot has a false-positive rate of 1 in 20,000.  Blood counts and viral load For pregnant women infected with HIV, in addition to the standard prenatal assessment, continued assessment of HIV status is important. A complete blood count to assess anemia and white blood cell count as well as renal and liver function tests should be included. Initial evaluation includes CD4 +  counts, which help determine the degree of immunodeficiency.  Viral load, determined by plasma HIV RNA copy number (copies/mL) assesses the risk of disease progression. The viral load is important in decisions regarding maternal treatment and delivery management; however, because perinatal HIV transmission can occur even at low or undetectable HIV RNA copy numbers, the viral load is not used in pregnancy to decide whether to start antiretroviral medications.  If a viral load is detected, antiretroviral drug resistance studies (HIV genotype) should be performed before starting therapy unless the diagnosis is made late in the pregnancy, in which case starting medications while awaiting results is recommended. In general, pregnancy has not been associated with a risk of rapid progression of HIV. [ 17]  With appropriate therapy, the viral load should drop by 1 log within the first month and become nondetectable within 6 months after initiating treatment. The higher the viral load, the longer the decrease may take; however, if the viral load persists or increases at 6 months, treatment failure must be considered.  Lipid profile and ultrasound Other laboratory studies should include a lipid profile, which is not usually obtained in pregnancy. Although cholesterol normally increases in pregnancy, baseline values are required, as certain medications have been associated with increased triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Evaluation of other infectious disease states and possible opportunistic infections, such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis, also needs to be done.  Initial obstetric ultrasonography for viability and dating is important for determining treatment and planning delivery. Potential teratogenicity is highest during the first trimester, and some patients may consider delaying treatment until after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. In women who are severely ill, the risks and benefits of this delay must be weighed. A targeted ultrasonography may be warranted depending on medication exposure.  Hepatitis testing Hepatitis B surface antigen status is recommended for all pregnant women. In the case of acute hepatitis B infection (HBV), the risk of vertical transmission also varies with gestational age, with an 80-90% risk of transmission to the offspring if the infection occurs in the third trimester. [ 23]  Women who are co-infected with HIV and chronic hepatitis B may require different management in pregnancy.  Co-infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common and may range from 17-54%. [ 24]  The diagnosis of hepatitis C is confirmed by identification of the hepatitis C antibody via an ELISA test. False-negative HCV test results may occur if the CD4 count is very low. More specific tests, (eg, hepatitis C viral RNA detection by polymerase chain reaction) are available. High maternal viral titers have been associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission.  All women who are chronic carriers of HBV or HCV should inform sexual partners, household contacts, and needle-sharing contacts and review precautions to decrease transmission.  Opportunistic infection assessment Assessment of the need for prophylaxis against  Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PCP) or  Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC) infection is necessary. For women with low CD4 counts, prophylaxis for PCP is with  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (TMP-SMX). Due to potential teratogenicity, aerosolized  pentamidine  may be substituted in the first trimester, as it is not absorbed systemically. For prophylaxis of MAC,  azithromycin  is used in place of clarithromycin because of potential teratogenicity. [ 14]  Other sexually transmitted disease testing Screening for other maternal sexually transmitted diseases is recommended in pregnancy. For example, screening for maternal syphilis is important not only for the prevention of congenital syphilis but also because maternal syphilis has been associated with an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. [ 25]  Vaginal speculum examination should be performed to obtain cervical cytology smear and assays for gonorrhea and chlamydia. All sexually transmitted diseases should be treated promptly. Genital warts and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia are more common among HIV-seropositive than HIV-seronegative women, but wart regression is as common in women with HIV as those without and cancer is infrequent. [ 26]  Women infected with HIV have a higher incidence of cervical dysplasia.  Vaccination Vaccinations should be kept updated. During pregnancy, live attenuated vaccines (eg, measles-mumps-rubella [MMR], varicella vaccines) should be avoided. Annual influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all pregnant women who are HIV positive. The H1N1 influenza vaccine should be administered to all pregnant women and is safe in women with HIV.  Tuberculosis testing Co-infection with HIV and tuberculosis is very common in developing nations. Immunosuppression from HIV infection contributes not only to a higher rate of tuberculosis reactivation but also to an increased disease severity.  Tuberculosis skin testing should be performed and a 5-mm purified protein derivative (PPD) result interpreted as positive. If positive, chest radiography can be performed during pregnancy because radiation risk is exceedingly low.  Presentation during labor For women who present in labor and have not had prenatal testing, rapid testing should be offered. Unlike the ELISA, the rapid HIV test is a blood or saliva antibody test and results are usually available within an hour. The rapid test is reported to have a high negative predictive value (100%) and to be highly sensitive and specific (approaching 100%); however, the positive predictive value in pregnancy varies from 44-100%. [ 4]  Patients who test positive in labor by ELISA should be treated as HIV positive until confirmatory results are available.  Antiretroviral Therapy Overview Mother-to-child transmission is linked to viral load. As such, antiretroviral therapy should be offered to all pregnant women infected with HIV to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission to below 2%. [ 27]  Combination antiretroviral therapy should be offered in all cases. As  zidovudine  (ZDV) is the only agent specifically shown to reduce perinatal transmission, it should be used whenever possible as part of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. [ 2]  If a pregnant woman has received antiretroviral medication in the past but is not currently on any medication, the choice of regimen may vary according to the history of prior use, the indication for stopping treatment in the past, gestational age, and resistance testing. In this setting, if there is no resistance to the drugs and the regimen suppressed viral load, antiretroviral medication can be used again, but avoid drugs with teratogenic potential or adverse maternal effects.  If a patient who is on a HAART regimen presents for prenatal care, continuing her treatment during the first trimester is reasonable, provided that care is taken to avoid medications that are contraindicated in early pregnancy. HIV antiretroviral drug resistance testing is recommended if a viral load is detectable. Considerations of drugs not usually used early in pregnancy may be necessary if drug resistance is confirmed and the patient receives extensive counseling regarding risk and benefits.  In an HIV-infected pregnant woman who has never been exposed to antiretroviral medication, HAART should be started as soon as possible, including during the first trimester. Again, recommendations are for drug-resistance testing and care to avoid medications that may potentially cause adverse maternal and fetal effects.  If prenatal HIV testing was not performed and a rapid HIV test returns preliminarily positive, the patient should be treated like any other woman infected with HIV. Certainly, the gestational age and obstetrical scenario may dictate the treatment options available, but as the exposure risk to antiretroviral medication is minimal to both mother and fetus, antiretroviral therapy should be initiated. [ 4]  The patient with a positive rapid test must be counseled regarding the possibility of a false-positive screen, and the results should be documented as preliminary in the medical chart. If this test was performed on arrival in labor, treatment with the ZDV protocol through labor is recommended, followed by administration to the neonate until confirmatory testing on the mother becomes available.  Antiretroviral regimens Treatment of women infected with HIV should not be withheld because of pregnancy. Although the decision regarding starting or maintaining current antiretroviral therapy is based on the same criteria as in nonpregnant patients, several considerations must be taken into account because of potential effects on the fetus.  The use of the 3-part ZDV prophylaxis regimen, alone or in combination with other antiretroviral medications, should be discussed and offered to all pregnant women because ZDV was the first agent to show significant decrease in the mother-to-child transmission of HIV. [ 2]  The regimen chosen should also take into account prior therapy and response to that regimen, as well as resistance testing. Gestational age and potential fetal and neonatal toxicity must also be taken into account when selecting a regimen.  The mechanism of action with which these drugs reduce perinatal transmission includes lowering maternal viral load; however, as these drugs cross the placenta, there appears to be prenatal prophylaxis as well. The third component, prophylaxis of the newborn, further decreases the risk of perinatal transmission.  The antiretroviral drugs used in pregnancy fall broadly into 3 categories: the nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). There are insufficient data to allow recommendations regarding the use of entry inhibitors or integrase inhibitors in pregnancy. Guidelines for perinatal ART were revised in July 2012 regarding which agents are considered preferred, alternative, or to be used under special circumstances. Combination regimens, usually including 2 NRTIs with either an NNRTI or 1 or more protease inhibitors (PIs) are recommended. For further information, see Table 1. Table 1. ART agents during pregnancy [ 18]  ART Class Preferred* Alternate Special Circumstances Insufficient Data to Recommend NRTIs zidovudine (ZDV) lamivudine (3TC) abacavir emtricitabine tenofovir didanosine stavudine - NNRTIs nevirapine - efavirenz etravirine rilpivirine PIs atazanavir lopinavir + ritonavir ritonavir darunavir saquinavir indinavir nelfinavir fosamprenavir tipranavir Fusion Inhibitors - - - enfuvirtide maraviroc Integrase Inhibitors - - raltegravir - *ZDV plus 3TC is a recommended dual-NRTI backbone regimen plus an NNRTI and 1 or more PIs for pregnant women with HIV Nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors The NRTIs are generally well tolerated and cross the placenta. The FDA has classified these as pregnancy class B or C, depending on the agent. These drugs do bind to mitochondrial DNA gamma polymerase and may cause mitochondrial dysfunction manifesting as cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, lactic acidosis, and liver dysfunction. Genetic susceptibility to these drugs may play a role, and the effects usually resolve with cessation of the medication. [ 1]  The combination of  didanosine  and  stavudine  has been associated with lactic acidosis and hepatic failure leading to fatalities and should be used with caution or only in cases where other NRTIs cannot be used due to resistance or toxicity. Finally, ZDV and stavudine have overlapping toxicities and are antagonistic and should be avoided in combination. [ 27]  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Five NNRTIs are FDA approved:  delavirdine  (Rescriptor),  efavirenz  (Sustiva),  etravirine  (Intelence),  nevirapine  (Viramune), and  rilpivirine  (Edurant). Although less information is available regarding NNRTI use in pregnancy, nevirapine and efavirenz both cross the placenta. The most common side effect is rash, which can occur in up to 17% of patients on nevirapine. [ 14]  Use of efavirenz is not recommended in the first trimester because of reported cases of fetal neural tube defects. The FDA has changed the pregnancy classification of this drug to category D. [ 28]  Severe nevirapine-associated skin rash and hepatic toxicity have been reported in pregnancy. The potentially fatal hepatotoxicity appears to be increased in women, during pregnancy, and in patients with a CD4 +  T-cell count greater than 250 cells/mL. Because of these significant complications, nevirapine should not be used as first-line therapy unless no other option is available.  In women whose CD4 +  T-cell counts were below 200 cells/mL and who were previously exposed to peripartum single-dose nevirapine, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus tenofovir-emtricitabine was superior to nevirapine plus tenofovir-emtricitabine for initial antiretroviral therapy. [ 29]  In children previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine for perinatal prevention of HIV transmission, zidovudine and lamivudine plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir for antiretroviral treatment resulted in better outcomes than treatment with zidovudine and lamivudine plus nevirapine. [ 30]  Protease inhibitors Protease inhibitors do not cross the placenta easily, and no teratogenic effects have been noted in animals. They are classified as class B or C by the FDA.  Also see the Medscape Drugs & Diseases topic  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . Peripartum Treatment In any pregnant woman infected with HIV who presents in labor, whether her HIV-positive status was previously known or was determined by rapid test result, more than one treatment option is available during labor and delivery. All HIV-infected women with HIV RNA ≥400 copies/mL (or unknown HIV RNA) near delivery should be administered IV  zidovudine  (ZDV) during labor, regardless of antepartum regimen or mode of delivery. IV ZDV is no longer required for HIV-infected women receiving combination ART regimens who have HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL near delivery. [ 18]  ZDV is given intravenously during labor at a dose of 2 mg/kg infused over 1 hour, followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg throughout labor. This regimen, along with maternal antepartum and infant zidovudine, reduced perinatal transmission by 66% overall. [ 18]  If the patient is having a planned cesarean delivery, the IV infusion should begin 3 hours before the procedure. [ 14,  27,  31]  Another option is ZDV infusion followed by a single dose of 200 mg of  nevirapine . This regimen should be followed by  lamivudine  (3TC) 150 mg every 12 hours. If the latter regimen is used in pregnancy, the patient must continue  ZDV/lamivudine  (Combivir) for at least 7 days post partum to avoid nevirapine resistance. [ 14]  Women with documented drug resistance to ZDV or whose antepartum regimen did not include ZDV should still be given the intravenous ZDV protocol during labor and delivery or before cesarean delivery. [ 14,  31]  Furthermore, the other antiretroviral agents must be continued on schedule throughout the intrapartum or preoperative period. Stavudine is the only agent that can antagonize ZDV and should be stopped prior to the IV infusion of ZDV. [ 27]  In patients attempting a vaginal delivery, all invasive procedures such as amniotomy, internal fetal scalp electrode, or scalp sampling should be avoided, as these may increase the risk of transmission.  When HAART is given solely for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission, it may be stopped in the postpartum period. The risk of promoting the development of resistant viral strains by using short courses of HAART can be decreased by using a maximally suppressive regimen and discontinuing all agents at the same time. The exception remains if the regimen includes a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). The NRTI should be continued for an additional 7 days to decrease the risk of resistance. [ 14]  Infant ART prophylaxis [ 18]  All HIV-exposed infants should receive zidovudine in the following doses:  < 30 weeks’ gestation: 2 mg/kg PO or 1.5 mg/kg IV BID; after age 4 weeks, advance to 3 mg/kg PO or 2.3 mg/kg IV q12hr >30 to < 35 weeks’ gestation: 2 mg/kg PO BID; after age 15 days, advance to 3 mg/kg PO or 2.3 mg/kg IV q12hr >35 weeks’ gestation: 4 mg/kg PO or 3 mg/kg IV BID x6 weeks Initiate as soon after delivery as possible (preferably within 6-12 hours) and continue through age 6 weeks and administer birth through 6 weeks.  Additional prophylaxis with nevirapine is needed for HIV-exposed infants of women who did not receive antepartum ART at the following weights and dosages:  Birth weight 1.5-2 kg: 8 mg/dose PO Birth weight >2 kg: 12 mg/dose PO Administer 3 doses in the first week of life; 1st dose 48 hours after birth, give 2nd dose 48 hours after 1st dose, and 3rd dose 96 hours after 2nd dose.  Hepatitis Co-infection The current recommendation for treating women co-infected with HIV and HBV is to treat these women with  tenofovir  and  lamivudine  or  emtricitabine . [ 32]  All 3 have shown activity against HBV. A meta-analysis found that the use of lamivudine effectively prevents mother-to-child transmission, even in pregnant women who have a high degree of HBV infectiousness in late pregnancy. [ 33]  Although data are insufficient for the use of tenofovir in pregnancy, the benefits likely outweigh the risks in women with HBV/HIV co-infection. Women receiving treatment should be advised of the signs and symptoms of liver toxicity, and regular follow-up of transaminase levels is warranted. The infant should receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin and start the 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine within the first 12 hours of life. [ 18]  Pregnancy does not appear to alter the course of HCV infection; however, co-infection with HIV does appear to increase the risk of perinatal transmission of HCV. As such, a 3-drug antiviral combination is recommended regardless of the viral load. As with HBV co-infection, patients should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of liver toxicity, and transaminases should be followed every 2-4 weeks.  As with HIV, prolonged rupture of membranes may increase the risk of perinatal HCV transmission; however, the data remain inconclusive regarding the use of cesarean section delivery to decrease the risk of transmission. As such, delivery recommendations are based on the HIV status. Infants can be evaluated by testing HCV RNA at 2 and 6 months of age or HCV antibody after 15 months of age. [ 18]  Cesarean Delivery Cesarean delivery  must be discussed and the patient counseled regarding the possibility of an unnecessary surgical procedure should the final HIV result be negative. [ 18]  Care should be individualized according to clinical scenario.  Early studies regarding cesarean delivery and transmission risk showed conflicting results. Cesarean delivery before the onset of labor may prevent microtransfusion that occurs with uterine contractions, and avoiding vaginal delivery eliminates exposure to virus in the cervicovaginal secretions and blood at time of delivery.  In the late 1990s, prospective cohort studies noted a decrease in mother-to-child transmission in women on zidovudine (ZDV) who underwent elective cesarean delivery compared with women who did not take ZDV prophylaxis. [ 34,  35]  In 1999, results from a large meta-analysis of individual patient data from 15 prospective cohort studies demonstrated a 50% reduction of vertical transmission with the use of elective cesarean delivery for women with HIV, after adjusting for antiretroviral therapy, maternal stage of disease, and infant birth weight.  Of note, vertical transmission risk did not change when the study group was limited to those women who had rupture of membranes shortly before surgery. The transmission risk was decreased by about 80% for women who had both an elective cesarean delivery and were taking antiretroviral medication. [ 36]  In the same year, ACOG issued an opinion that elective cesarean delivery should be discussed and offered to all pregnant women who were HIV positive at 38 weeks’ gestation to avoid the potential risk of spontaneous labor and rupture of membranes. [ 31]  These studies did not adjust for viral load and were performed before HAART came into use. In patients on HAART with an undetectable viral load (< 1000 copies), the risk of transmission is very low, and whether cesarean delivery offers any further benefit remains unknown.  This led to an updated ACOG statement in 2000, stating that women infected with HIV whose viral loads are greater than 1,000 copies/mL should be counseled regarding the potential benefit of scheduled cesarean delivery to further reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV beyond that achieved with antiretroviral therapy alone. [ 31]  However, data are insufficient to demonstrate a benefit for neonates of women with viral loads less than 1,000 copies/mL.  Longer duration of ruptured membranes may be associated with a higher rate of mother-to-child transmission. The International Perinatal HIV group meta-analysis found that the risk of vertical transmission increased by 2% for every increase of 1 hour in the duration of ruptured membranes. If cesarean delivery is performed after the onset of labor or rupture of membranes, the benefit of surgery may be lost. In this scenario, a decision regarding the route of delivery should be individualized. [ 31,  36]  Operative risk may outweigh the potential benefit of further reducing HIV transmission. In a study by Louis et al that compared the outcome of cesarean section in 378 women infected with HIV and in more than 54,000 uninfected women, HIV-infected women had a higher rate of intraoperative need for blood transfusion as well as increased incidence of postpartum endometritis, sepsis, pneumonia, admission to the intensive care unit, and maternal death. [ 37]  In the HIV-infected group, morbidity and mortality were associated with infection and related to immune function, with the greatest risk being for women with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mL. [ 37]  Because morbidity is increased in women infected with HIV who undergo cesarean delivery, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered. Scheduled cesarean delivery should be discussed and recommended for women with viral loads greater than 1000 copies/mL, whether or not they are taking antiretroviral therapy.  Discussion of the option of scheduled cesarean delivery should begin as early as possible in pregnancy with every pregnant woman infected with HIV, to give her an adequate opportunity to consider the choice and plan for the procedure. The risks, which appear to be greater for the mother, must be balanced with the benefits expected for the neonate. The patient's autonomy must be respected when making the decision to perform a cesarean delivery, because the potential for maternal morbidity is significant.  Consultation and follow-up with specialists in infectious disease and maternal-fetal medicine is recommended.  Diet and Activity During pregnancy, a healthy, well-balanced diet is recommended, and this recommendation is not altered by HIV. Certain foods need to be limited and avoided during all pregnancies. Alcohol should be avoided. Generally, eating fish low in mercury content is recommended. Caffeine must also be limited, as well as foods high in nitrites and soft cheeses. Current available evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy (not to exceed 10,000 IU in the first trimester) improves birth weight. [ 38]  Light exercise is recommended in pregnancy, and this recommendation is not altered by HIV infection. Walking and swimming are excellent programs during pregnancy. Women should discuss their exercise routine with their physician.  Deterrence and Prevention Currently, no vaccine is available for HIV; therefore, prevention is crucial to decreasing the risk of transmission. [ 39]  Women must be counseled on methods to avoid transmission to others, including safe sex practice and avoiding donation of blood or organs.  Regular use of latex condoms and avoidance of unprotected intercourse is important. Treatment of genital tract infections and inflammation in both partners is important to avoid mucosal breaks. The frequent use of nonoxyynol-9 vaginal gel has been associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition in the high-risk population. Women should not share toothbrushes or razors, as small amounts of blood may be present.  In areas of the world where safe alternatives are available, breastfeeding is not recommended. This also applies to women on antiretroviral therapy. [ 5,  14]  Passage of antiretrovirals into breast milk has been shown for several agents, including zidovudine and lamivudine. [ 18]  ",

				"body": "Overview Background Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, also termed Sweet syndrome, is a reactive process characterized by the abrupt onset of tender, red-to-purple papules, and nodules that coalesce to form plaques. The plaques usually occur on the upper extremities, face, or neck and are typically accompanied by fever and peripheral neutrophilia. [ 1]  Described in 1964 by Robert Sweet, the entity currently recognized as Sweet syndrome ranges from classic Sweet disease, which occurs in young women after a mild respiratory illness, to a more aggressive neutrophilic process, which may be associated with other inflammatory diseases or malignancy. [ 1,  2,  3]  In fact, the lesions may be the first evidence of an underlying disorder and should prompt further investigation. A drug-induced variant due to the administration of various medications has been recognized, and a pregnancy-associated form has also been reported. [ 1,  4,  5,  6]  In general, Sweet syndrome responds dramatically to oral corticosteroids and may improve or resolve with treatment of the underlying condition. Without treatment, the syndrome may persist for weeks or months and then improves without leaving scars. Recurrences are common. In rare cases, crops of lesions reappear and the condition persists indefinitely. Cases associated with malignancy can be bullous or ulcerative and resemble atypical  pyoderma gangrenosum . These lesions are often recalcitrant to treatment. [ 1,  7,  8,  9]  The diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is based on both clinical and histopathologic findings. Characteristics that distinguish the lesions of Sweet syndrome from other neutrophilic dermatosis are healing of the lesions without scarring and an absence of vasculitis. However, recent reports suggest that vasculitis should not exclude the diagnosis since it has been shown to occur in many patients with Sweet syndrome, which may represent an epiphenomenon instead of a primary immune-mediated process. [ 10]  Pathophysiology Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) is a reactive process (a hypersensitivity reaction) that occurs in response to systemic factors, such as hematologic disease, infection, inflammation, vaccination, or drug exposure. [ 11]  The condition is neutrophil mediated, as evidenced by its histopathologic appearance, associated neutrophilia, and response to medications that affect neutrophil activity. [ 1]  The association of exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) with the development of Sweet syndrome also supports the importance of neutrophils and related endogenous cytokines in the underlying process. G-CSF suppresses apoptosis and prolongs the survival of neutrophils in vivo in a CD34 +  cell population. G-CSF levels in peripheral blood are increased in patients with active Sweet syndrome, suggesting that high levels of G-CSF may one day be a useful indicator of activity level of the disease. The functional properties of neutrophils, rather than the absolute number, is thought to be significant because patients with Sweet syndrome due to G-CSF develop lesions as the neutrophil count rapidly increases, despite the absolute neutrophil count being low. [ 8,  12,  13]  See the  Absolute Neutrophil Count  calculator. In addition, some studies have suggested a role for tumor necrosis factor, and others have suggested an imbalance of type 1 helper T cells. Although the skin is the primary organ affected, other systems, most notably the lungs and kidneys, can also be involved. Other reactive neutrophilic disorders, such as neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, are closely related and may represent a spectrum with related pathogenesis. [ 9]  A possible genetic link with HLA-B54 has been observed in the Japanese population. A report of 2 brothers who developed Sweet syndrome in the neonatal period also supports a genetic predisposition. Structural alterations in the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q) have been seen in association with Sweet syndrome; these changes involve genes that affect the regulation of granulopoiesis and neutrophil migration. [ 14]  Epidemiology Frequency Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) is uncommon but not rare. In several series, 10 -20% of cases have occurred in a setting of malignancy, though most are idiopathic or associated with benign conditions. [ 6,  7]  Race Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) has no known racial predilection. [ 1]  Sex The common reactive variant of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) does have a female predominance, with a female-to-male ratio of 15:1. [ 15]  However, this predilection was not noted in series of cases associated with malignancy. [ 16]  No sex predisposition has been observed in children. [ 17]  Age Typically, women with acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) are aged 30-50 years. [ 1]  However, cases in neonates as young as 5 days have been described. [ 18]  In children, Sweet syndrome is extremely rare and generally associated with infection. [ 17]  Sweet syndrome occurring in an infant should prompt a workup for immunodeficiency, as well as a review of the peripheral blood smear to rule out the rare case of malignancy. Clinical Presentation History Fever typically precedes the appearance of each crop of lesions in acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome). The fever can precede the skin disease by several days to weeks; however, it may also occur simultaneously. [ 1]  The crop of plaques or nodules in the classic form often appears abruptly and may persist for weeks or several months (days to weeks) if untreated. [ 1,  4]  Many patients report a febrile upper respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, or flulike syndrome 1-3 weeks prior to onset of skin lesions. Vaccination or a gastrointestinal tract infection may also precede the eruption. [ 4,  11]  Headache, malaise, and arthralgias are common. [ 1,  19]  Physical Skin manifestations of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Typical skin lesions are bright red, reddish blue, or violet papules, plaques, or nodules. Massive subepidermal edema sometimes produces a deceptively vesicular appearance. Lesions may be studded with pustules. Papules often coalesce into circinate or arcuate plaques. [ 1,  4,  7,  19]  Plaques can cause pain and burning, but they are not pruritic. Lesions spontaneously resolve without scarring, or they resolve after treatment. [ 1]  The face, neck, and extremities primarily are affected, characteristically in an asymmetric distribution. [ 1]  Atypical presentations in the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane are reported. Facial cellulitis and soft tissue infections of the extremities have also been described. [ 20,  21]  Other atypical presentations include photodistributed violaceous plaques with heliotrope rash, malar erythema, scalp involvement, and Gottron-like papules. [ 22]  Ulcers and bullae are more common in malignancy-associated disease than in other forms. These lesions may be extensive and are generally hard to treat. [ 4]  Lesions on the dorsum of the hand are not uncommon. They sometimes appear vasculitic, which is not typically seen in Sweet syndrome. [ 19]  The lesions are predominantly distributed over the dorsal aspects of the fingers and hands in a roughly symmetrical pattern. Other extensor surfaces may also be involved. [ 19]  This is an anatomically limited form of Sweet syndrome. [ 10]  Atypical pyoderma gangrenosum, bullous Sweet syndrome, and pustular vasculitis of the hands are considered by some to be variations of a single disease, neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands. [ 23]  The vasculitis does not appear to be a primary immune-mediated process, as is seen in the primary leukocytoclastic vasculitides; rather, it is secondary vascular damage caused by toxic metabolites and proteases released from the extensive acute neutrophilic infiltrates in the skin. [ 10]  Note the images below: Red nodules and plaques on the lateral aspect of the hand.  Red nodules and plaques on the lateral aspect of the hand.  Multiple lesions on the scalp.  Multiple lesions on the scalp.  Close-up of a scalp lesion.  Close-up of a scalp lesion.  Mucosal lesions of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Oral lesions can occur on the lips, buccal mucosa, and/or tongue. These lesions most commonly appear as ulcers in Sweet syndrome patients with hematologic disorders. [ 8]  Conjunctivitis and episcleritis may also occur; these are the most common eye manifestations. Other ocular manifestations reported include uveitis, limbal nodules, glaucoma, subconjunctival hemorrhage, scleritis, iritis, and sudden visual loss. [ 24,  25,  26]  Extracutaneous manifestations of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Sweet syndrome can involve several organ systems. [ 1]  Pulmonary manifestations can sometimes lead to substantial morbidity. Pulmonary involvement may manifest as dyspnea, chronic cough, or pulmonary infiltrates or effusions on chest radiograph. In rare cases, symptoms may become severe enough to cause respiratory failure or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Fortunately, most cases of Sweet syndrome with pulmonary involvement tend to be highly responsive to glucocorticoid therapy. [ 27,  28,  29]  Other extracutaneous sites that have been reported include the bones, intestines, joints, bone marrow, liver, heart, muscles, spleen, and kidneys. [ 1,  30,  31,  32,  33,  34,  35,  36,  37,  38]  A few cases of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) progressing to shock and organ dysfunction has been reported, with rapid improvement using high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. The treatment efficacy highlights the association of SIRS with Sweet syndrome, which can be hard to distinguish from infection. [ 39,  40,  41]  Among children, cases of acquired cutis laxa have been reported in lesions consistent with Sweet syndrome. [ 42]  A 2-year-old girl diagnosed with both Sweet syndrome and cutis laxa was found to have acute necrosis in the cardiac apex and interventricular septum and focal chronic inflammatory and granulation tissue in the aortic wall. The authors suggest that children with both Sweet syndrome and cutis laxa undergo complete cardiac evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist, as these findings can be fatal. [ 43]  Fewer than 30 cases of CNS involvement are reported in the literature. Encephalitis and meningitis are common neurologic manifestations in these cases. Peripheral neuropathy has also been reported. The most common symptoms are headaches, disturbed consciousness, and seizures. [ 44]  HLA types B54 and CW1 are associated with Sweet syndrome with CNS involvement in Japanese patients. [ 44]  Unlike  Behçet syndrome , in which CNS involvement is progressive and severe, Sweet syndrome usually causes transient CNS involvement, but recurrences may occur. [ 44]  Proteinuria, hematuria, and decreased creatinine clearance have been reported. [ 16]  See the  Creatinine Clearance (measured)  calculator. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis also has been described, as has a sterile chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis in children. [ 45]  Pathergy Like  pyoderma gangrenosum , Sweet syndrome is known to cause pathergy (also referred to as Köebner phenomenon), in which lesions occur in areas of minor trauma, such as sites of scratches, bites, and venipuncture. [ 46]  The lesions may also be photodistributed or localized to the site of a previous phototoxic reaction (eg, sunburn). [ 1,  46]  Underlying disease It is important to recognize and treat any associated or underlying systemic diseases or malignancies. Sweet syndrome may be a clue to the diagnosis of a systemic disorder or malignancy, and important clues should not be ignored. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, CT scanning, PET scanning, or MRI, may be helpful in identifying underlying malignancies. Pregnancy Acute neutrophilic dermatosis can occur during pregnancy and may recur in subsequent pregnancies. Presently, it is believed that the disease is not associated with fetal harm. Causes Potential causes of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) are numerous, but some associations are well documented. [ 5]  Classic or idiopathic Sweet syndrome is the most common presentation and accounts for more than 50% of cases. [ 47]  Sweet syndrome associated with a (malignant) neoplasm accounts for approximately 11-54% of the cases. Most of these are hematopoietic malignancies (most commonly acute myeloid leukemia), but some are due to solid tumors, mostly those involving the genitourinary, breast, and gastrointestinal tract. Inflammatory (infectious) conditions are the next most frequently identified causes of Sweet syndrome. [ 5,  47]  Hematologic malignancy–related causes of febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Myelodysplasia and chronic myelogenous leukemia may be associated with Sweet syndrome. [ 16,  48]  Sweet syndrome can also be seen in association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including the promyelocytic (M3) variant of AML. [ 16,  49]  Other nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies that have occurred in association with acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis include Hodgkin disease, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and multiple myeloma. (Patients with immunoglobulin G [IgG] secretion may be at increased risk for Sweet syndrome). [ 33,  50]  Nonhematologic malignancy has been associated with Sweet syndrome; rates of genitourinary, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers appear to be slightly increased in this group. [ 16]  Nonhematologic malignancy–related causes of febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) These are rare associations and include osteosarcoma, oral cancer/tonsil cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, pheochromocytoma, and cervical and rectal carcinoma. [ 9,  50,  51]  Infection-related causes of febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Multiple infections are described in association with Sweet syndrome, often involving the upper respiratory tract. Streptococcal pneumonia is the most commonly described infection. [ 46]  Other bacterial infections associated with Sweet syndrome also include those due to  Salmonella  or  Staphylococcus  species,  Francisella tularensis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Entamoeba coli, Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi,  nontuberculous organisms, (atypical),  Tuberculous mycobacteria, Mycobacterium chelonae , and  Penicillium  species. [ 46,  52,  53]  Sweet syndrome may be a presenting feature of coccidiomycosis and associated with sporotrichosis. [ 28,  54]  Viral agents such as HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and parvovirus B19 has also been implicated. [ 55,  56]  Yersinia -associated Sweet syndrome has been noted to improve with antibiotics. [ 57]  Drug-related causes of febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Multiple drugs have been reported to cause Sweet syndrome, with some of these reactions being noted in patients with underlying malignancy; therefore, the validity of these possible associations is unclear. [ 1]  Because the dominant cell in the dermal infiltrate is a neutrophil, drug-induced Sweet syndrome is not considered to be a drug hypersensitivity. G-CSF is a well-established factor. [ 1,  58]  Established factors include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), all- trans  retinoic acid, and minocycline, which have all appeared in more than 1 case report. [ 6]  Anecdotal or limited reports of drug or device associations include lithium, furosemide, hydralazine, carbamazepine, oral contraceptives, the Mirena intrauterine device, COX-2 inhibitors, azathioprine, doxycycline, diazepam, diclofenac, nitrofurantoin, propylthiouracil, lenalidomide, bortezomib, abacavir, imatinib, 5-azacytidine, decitabine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), clindamycin, mitoxantrone, and vaccinations (eg, for bacille Calmette-Guérin, smallpox, pneumococcal organisms, influenza). [ 11,  36,  59,  60,  61,  62,  63,  64,  65,  66,  67,  68]  Systemic disorder–related causes of febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Associated inflammatory disease can be identified in about 16% of patients with Sweet syndrome. [ 47]  The most common associated diseases are  Crohn disease  and  ulcerative colitis , which some authors consider part of a continuum of neutrophilic dermatosis. [ 69]  Sjögren syndrome ,  Behçet disease ,  lupus erythematosus ,  rheumatoid arthritis , familial Mediterranean fever, and undifferentiated connective-tissue disease have been reported in association with acute neutrophilic dermatitis. [ 1,  70]  Miscellaneous causes of febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) Rare cases of acute neutrophilic dermatitis have occurred with spinal surgery,  sarcoidosis ,  erythema nodosum ,  relapsing polychondritis , thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. [ 1,  71,  72,  73,  74]  A few cases have been observed during pregnancy. [ 1,  5,  16]  Several cases of Sweet syndrome occurred with  polycythemia vera . [ 75]  One patient had a mutation in the prothrombin gene ( G20210A ), but no conclusive association can be made at this time. [ 76]  A few cases of Sweet syndrome have been reported in the literature in transplantation patients, including those undergoing bone marrow and kidney transplantation. Although these patients are taking immunomodulatory medications, an “immune mediated state” has been described to explain the manifestation of Sweet syndrome in this patient population. [ 77]  Sweet syndrome as a manifestation of HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has been suggested. [ 78]  Diagnostic criteria Diagnostic criteria (proposed by Su and Liu [ 79]  and revised by von den Driesch [ 47]  ) include the presence of 2 major and 2 minor clinical findings, as follows: Major criteria are as follows: Abrupt onset of tender or painful erythematous plaques or nodules, occasionally with vesicles, pustules, or bullae Predominantly neutrophilic infiltration in the dermis without leukocytoclastic vasculitis Minor criteria are as follows: Preceding nonspecific respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection or vaccination or associated with inflammatory disease, hemoproliferative disorders, solid malignant tumors, or pregnancy Periods of general malaise and fever (body temperature >38°C) Laboratory values during onset showing a erythrocyte sedimentation rate >20 mm, positive C-reactive protein (CRP) result, segmented nuclear neutrophils, bands >70% in peripheral blood smears, and leukocytosis (count >8000/µL) (meeting 3 of 4 of these values is necessary Excellent response to treatment with systemic corticosteroids or potassium iodide Diagnostic criteria for drug-induced Sweet syndrome (proposed by Walker and Cohen [ 6]  ) include all 5 criteria below; all of the following are required for the drug eruptions to be considered a diagnosis of drug-induced Sweet syndrome: Abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules Histopathologic evidence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis Pyrexia (38°C) Temporal relationship between drug ingestion and clinical presentation, or temporally related recurrence after oral challenge Temporally related resolution of lesions after drug withdrawal or treatment with systemic corticosteroids [ 6]  Workup Laboratory Studies The diagnosis of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) is usually based on histopathologic examination by a qualified dermatopathologist, but the laboratory findings are nonspecific. Clinicopathologic correlation is important because the bowel bypass syndrome may present with skin lesions with an identical histologic picture. [ 1,  4,  5]  Several tests are helpful, as follows: A CBC count with differential must be ordered to screen for underlying hematologic disorders. Neutrophilia is typically present, but the absence of neutrophilia in a patient who is neutropenic does not rule out Sweet syndrome. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are common in patients with underlying malignancy. Abnormalities in the CBC count should prompt consideration of bone marrow biopsy. [ 1,  4,  19]  The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP level should be determined. The ESR is elevated in more than 90% of cases, and the C-reactive protein value also may be elevated. However, both of these findings are nonspecific manifestations of inflammation. [ 1,  4]  Other findings may be as follows: Urinalysis may show proteinuria and/or hematuria. [ 16]  On a hepatic panel, concentrations of hepatic enzymes may be elevated nonspecifically. [ 46]  Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) have been described but not consistently found in all patients with Sweet syndrome. [ 80]  Lesions should be cultured for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria to rule out infection. [ 1]  Imaging Studies A chest radiograph should be obtained if pulmonary symptoms of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) are present because lung involvement may occur and is responsive to systemic corticosteroids. [ 5]  Sweet syndrome is the presenting sign of malignancy in approximately two thirds of the cases of malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. [ 5]  The presence of ulcerative lesions, oral lesions, abnormal platelet counts, or anemia should prompt investigation for an underlying malignancy. [ 16]  Some authors recommend a directed systemic evaluation in all patients with Sweet syndrome. [ 47]  If an underlying malignancy is suspected, the appropriate imaging modality should be used for early detection and treatment. [ 1]  2-[fluorine 18]-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is especially useful in evaluating myeloproliferative disorders, but they can also be helpful in assessing some solid tumors and has successfully depicted early malignancies. [ 81]  Procedures Skin biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome). [ 1]  Bone marrow aspiration is indicated if CBC count is abnormal, and it should be considered in all cases of atypical bullous or ulcerative Sweet syndrome. [ 5]  Age-appropriate cancer screening and evaluation for  inflammatory bowel disease  are indicated if no other underlying cause is found, especially in patients with bullous or ulcerative lesions. [ 1]  Histologic Findings The classic histopathologic pattern of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) consists of a dense, diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate in the reticular dermis. Leukocytoclastic nuclear debris is typically present interstitially, and massive papillary dermal edema is common. True vasculitic changes (expansion of postcapillary venule wall with fibrin deposition) are typically absent, though subtle vasculitic changes may occur. Eosinophils and lymphocytes are present in some instances, but neutrophils usually predominate. [ 1]  The epidermis usually is spared, though nonspecific findings such as spongiosis and subcorneal pustule formation can be seen. [ 4]  Results of direct immunofluorescence testing are noncontributory. In rare cases, the inflammation extends to involve the subcutis. In essentially all instances, cases with subcutaneous involvement also show extensive involvement of the reticular dermis. [ 4]  Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a variant that has been described and includes histiocytoid cells, which are immature myeloid cells commonly mistaken as histiocytes. The most important differential diagnosis for this variant is leukemia cutis. [ 82]  Treatment & Management Medical Care In most cases of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome), prednisone is extremely and rapidly effective, in doses of 1 mg/kg/d. [ 1,  47]  Pulmonary infiltrates also tend to respond promptly to prednisone. [ 27]  However, despite the initial excellent response, recurrences of neutrophilic dermatitis are common and generally develop as steroid use is being tapered. If the underlying disease flares, it may take longer to effectively taper therapy. [ 1]  High-potency topical steroids (eg, clobetasol propionate 0.05%) or intralesional glucocorticoids (eg, triamcinolone acetonide 3.0-10 mg/mL) may also be useful in localized lesions. [ 5]  For long-term management, numerous drugs may be helpful. Many of the medications work by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis, but none have been shown to be better than corticosteroids. [ 1,  5]  Indomethacin, colchicine, and potassium iodide were helpful in small series of patients. [ 1,  83,  84]  A retrospective study evaluating 90 patients with acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis demonstrated the effective use of colchicine as first-line therapy. [ 85]  Dapsone, cyclosporine, etretinate, pentoxifylline, and clofazimine also have been used, with anecdotal success. [ 1,  44,  47,  86]  Doxycycline, metronidazole, isotretinoin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, adalimumab, infliximab, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), pulse doses of methylprednisolone, and interferon alfa are also reportedly successful. [ 1,  44,  47,  86,  87,  88,  89]  If an underlying cause can be identified, it should be treated, eg, by means of resection of solid tumors, treatment of infections, and discontinuation of causative medication. Successful therapy of the underlying disorder may promote resolution of Sweet syndrome and prevent recurrences. [ 4,  5]  Etanercept has been reported to control the skin manifestations of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis in a small case series of rheumatoid arthritis patients. [ 90]  However, care must be taken when using this treatment in a group with concomitant or a high likelihood of cancer. [ 91]  In the treatment of recalcitrant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, thalidomide has been used to clear lesions within 1 month after therapy with corticosteroids, metronidazole, dapsone, and methotrexate failed. [ 92]  Anakinra and rituximab have also been reported to be effective in refractory cases. [ 93,  94]  In the pediatric population, long-term use of corticosteroids can cause problems with linear growth, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. Children may also have social sequelae associated with their use. Therefore, attempts are usually made to treat children with steroid-sparing drugs. [ 14]  A case of cutis laxa–like lesions in skin previously affected by Sweet syndrome 9 months after presentation and treatment with corticosteroids has been described in an 8-month-old child. [ 42]  Consultations Consultation with a dermatologist is indicated for the diagnosis and evaluation of underlying causes of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome). An internal medicine specialist may be consulted to evaluate any underlying or triggering diseases. Follow-up Further Outpatient Care Outpatient care for the skin lesions of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) is usually coordinated by a dermatologist in conjunction with other physicians who may be involved if other underlying diseases are present. Deterrence/Prevention Deterrence is based on avoiding known triggers, such as medications, and treatment of underlying conditions that may be factors. Complications Generally, lesions resolve without scarring, though pigmentary changes may take months to fade. Prognosis Most cases of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) resolve, though some persist indefinitely and can be difficult to manage because of pain and skin breakdown. Because this condition can be associated with many other diseases, including malignancy, the patient's overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause. [ 5]   The outcome depends on the underlying condition, but recurrence may occur in up to 50% of patients and is most likely in cases associated with hematologic malignancy or drug reactions. Patient Education Patient education should include information about the variable course of this condition, as well as advice on self-monitoring for signs and symptoms of other diseases. Differential Diagnoses Diagnostic Considerations Also consider the following: Bowel-associated dermatitis-arthritis syndrome Neutrophilic rheumatoid dermatitis Leukocytoclastic vasculitis Acral erythema Leukemia cutis Acute hemorrhagic edema of childhood Halogenoderma Rosacea  fulminans [ 5]  Allergic Contact Dermatitis Cellulitis Dermatologic Aspects of Behcet Disease Dermatologic Manifestations of Herpes Simplex Drug Eruptions Erythema Multiforme Erythema Nodosum Pyoderma Gangrenosum Medication Medication Summary The goals of pharmacotherapy are to reduce morbidity and to prevent complications. Corticosteroids Class Summary Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties and cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, these agents modify the body's immune response to diverse stimuli.  Prednisone (Deltasone) Prednisone is useful in acute neutrophilic dermatitis because of its anti-inflammatory properties. It must be metabolized to the active metabolite prednisolone for effect. Conversion may be impaired in those with liver disease. Anti-inflammatories Class Summary These agents modulate events leading to inflammatory reactions. Dapsone (Avlosulfon) Dapsone is bactericidal and bacteriostatic against mycobacteria; its mechanism of action is similar to that of sulfonamides for which competitive antagonists of PABA prevent formation of folic acid, inhibiting bacterial growth. Colchicine Colchicine decreases leukocyte motility and phagocytosis in inflammatory responses. It has effects against neutrophils, which are probably involved in the expression of cutaneous vasculitis; it has been demonstrated to be steroid sparing in open-label studies. The only double-blinded placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate its efficacy; however, several methodological errors occurred in this study. It is not FDA approved in children.

				"body": "Overview Cognitive disorder in the setting of HIV infection was recognized a long time ago and was referred to with various names. The term AIDS dementia complex was introduced by Navia and colleagues in 1986. [ 1,  2]  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters the central nervous system (CNS) early in the course of the infection and causes several important CNS conditions over the course of the disease, such as HIV encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex. [ 3]  As part of the acute HIV syndrome during seroconversion, patients may experience HIV encephalopathy. HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy (HPE) is a syndrome complex with cognitive, motor, and behavioral features seen in children. [ 4]  Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), dementia was a common source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. It was usually observed in the late stages of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), when CD4 +  lymphocyte counts fall below 200 cells/mL, and was seen in up to 50% of patients prior to their deaths. [ 5]  In 1986, the term AIDS dementia complex (ADC) was introduced to describe a unique constellation of neurobehavioral findings. [ 6,  7]  HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) encompass a hierarchy of progressively more severe patterns of neurological involvement. It can range from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) to minor neurocognitive disorder (MND) to more severe HIV-associated dementia (HAD) (also called AIDS dementia complex [ADC] or HIV encephalopathy). ADC is considered a single entity with a broad and varied spectrum of clinical manifestations and severity. [ 8]  ADC is characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral features in adults, usually those with advanced AIDS. With the advent of HAART, a less severe dysfunction, minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD), has become more common than ADC. The overall psychosocial and emotional burden on the family and friends of patients with HIV dementia is tremendous, far beyond that of a cognitively intact patient with AIDS. Patients with cognitive difficulties have problems with compliance and adherence to their medication regimen. Because of their neuropsychiatric problems, these patients are likely to be less inhibited and are more prone to HIV-related risk behavior (eg, unprotected intercourse), and they therefore pose a greater risk of transmission of the virus. In addition to HIV itself, other causes of neurologic complications in HIV-infected individuals include opportunistic infections, tumors, and antiretroviral drugs. Other neurologic complications that arise from primary HIV infection include vacuolar myelopathy, peripheral neuropathies, and polymyositis. For other discussions of HIV infection, see  HIV Disease ,  Pediatric HIV Infection , and  Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection . Pathophysiology HIV is thought to enter the brain via HIV-infected macrophages and lymphocytes. The other proposed mechanisms include passage of cell-free virus into the brain and release of the virus from the infected endothelial cells. [ 9]  The virus replicates in these cells and can then, in theory, infect other cells, such as microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons; macrophages and microglia are the most commonly infected cells. HIV infection in the CNS can be detected and monitored by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load measurements. A positive correlation has been established by many researchers between CSF viral load and the extent of cognitive dysfunction. Immunohistochemistry studies show that the virus is most densely located in the basal ganglia, subcortical regions, and frontal cortex. Pathologic changes at autopsy are also predominantly subcortical, involving the deep-gray (ie, basal ganglia, thalamus) and white-matter regions. The mechanism by which HIV infection of the CNS leads to neurocognitive disorders is likely multifactorial and is the subject of intense research. Cellular proteins Widespread pathologic damage may occur via indirect cellular responses with the secretion of chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, nitrous oxide, and other neurotoxic factors. These products are produced not only from the infected cells (eg, macrophages, astrocytes, microglia) but also from noninfected activated cells. Much attention has been placed on chemokines, such as CCL4 and CXCL12, and their respective chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4. These may affect many cellular processes, including neuronal migration, apoptosis, and neurotransmitter regulation. HIV proteins (virotoxins) Studies in several transgenic mouse models indicate that expression of a single or multiple HIV genes leads to clinical and histologic abnormalities. [ 10]  Damage to neurons may occur through the actions of specific HIV proteins, including gp120, gp41, Tat, Nef, Vpr, and Rev. These viral proteins may be directly toxic to neuronal cells or may cause damage by activating astrocytes, microglia and macrophages to release cytokines, chemokines, or neurotoxic substances. [ 11,  12,  13]  By initiating feedback loops, virotoxins may amplify their toxicity and cause widespread damage. The basal ganglia show the highest immunostaining by the HIV p24 antigen. Some studies show that gp41 expression in the basal ganglia and frontal lobes correlates significantly with the severity of dementia. However, the presence of macrophages and microglia correlate better with clinical dementia than with the amount of HIV-infected cells in the brain, as determined by gp41-positive cells. [ 14]  Neuronal death in vitro is caused by gp120 and is accompanied by the opening of calcium channels in the neuronal membrane. HIV p53 (tumor suppressor transcription factor) [ 15]  appears to have multiple roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. HIV proteins Tat and gp120 cause microglia to release factors that promote neuronal p53 activation. All 3 cell types in the brain (microglia, astrocytes, and neurons) accumulate p53, causing cell cycle arrest; in neurons, this ultimately induces apoptosis and cell death by oxidative injury and DNA damage. [ 16]  Viral proteins Tat and gp120 have been shown to have synergistic neurotoxicity with cocaine and methamphetamine. Thus, users of these drugs may have a higher likelihood of developing ADC. Autoimmune disease CNS damage may occur by humoral immune mechanisms, as evidenced by the presence of anti-CNS antibodies in AIDS patients with dementia but not in those without dementia. [ 17]  Autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein may persist in a high percentage of patients despite viral clearance; this finding suggests ongoing neuroinflammation, which may prevent recovery from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. [ 18]  Risk factors Several risk factors for ADC have been identified, including low weight, anemia, constitutional symptoms, low CD4 +  count, and high plasma HIV-RNA load. The prevalence of ADC increases threefold with a CD4 +  count of less than 200/µL and increases sevenfold with a CD4 +  count of less than 100/µL. Patients with concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may have a worse cognitive status than do those without. A report implicated apolipoprotein E4 as a risk factor for the development of dementia. Female gender may be a risk factor for HIV dementia. [ 19]  Some studies have found that women with HIV may have a more rapid progression of neurologic symptoms and signs. [ 20,  21]  The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study reported that older age was associated with more rapid progression to dementia and death. [ 22]  Becker et al reported that the prevalence of cognitive disorders in persons who are HIV positive and older than 50 years was significantly greater than in younger patients. [ 23]  A history of substance abuse does not appear to be a risk factor for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. A study of 399 patients found that the rate of HIV neurocognitive effects is about the same in those with and without a history of substance abuse. [ 24]  Epidemiology The risk of severe neurocognitive disorders in patients with HIV is 1 in 1000; patients who are not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and who have a low CD4 +  lymphocyte count are at particular risk. [ 25]  In 4-15% of AIDS dementia complex (ADC) patients, ADC is the presenting clinical manifestation of HIV disease. [ 20]  The annual incidence of HIV dementia in the Western world prior to HAART was 7%, with a cumulative risk of 5-20%. [ 20]  With HAART, the incidence of HIV dementia started declining, but it has begun to increase again. [ 26]  The incidence of HIV-1 encephalopathy has been increasing in the HAART era, and the prevalence of the disorder is now increasing; the cumulative incidence is 25-38%, and the prevalence is around 37%. [ 20]  Milder forms of ADC affect an additional 30-40% of patients. In the HAART period, rapidly progressive dementia is less commonly a presentation; chronic and fluctuating forms of HIV dementia are more common. With the changing face of HIV infection and AIDS, a geographic difference in how AIDS dementia complex (ADC) presents is now clear. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has brought dramatic changes in the lives of patients and has divided regions into \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" On one hand, in developed countries such as the United States, HIV-infected patients rarely present for the first time with a full-blown ADC picture; on the other hand, in regions of Africa where HAART is not available, this scenario is still the norm. United States statistics According to the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, which prospectively followed 2734 American men with HIV, before HAART (1990-1992) the incidence of HIV dementia was 21 cases per 1000 person-years; and after the advent of HAART (1996-1998) the incidence decreased to 10.5 cases per 1000 person-years. In an observational study involving 1555 HIV-infected adults in the era of HAART, 33% have asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment, 12% have mild neurocognitive impairment, and only 2% have HIV-associated dementia. [ 27]  In a large US cohort, the likelihood of ADC was similar in white and nonwhite patients. The race distribution of ADC reflects the high incidence and prevalence of HIV disease in the African-American community. Similarly, the sex distribution of ADC reflects that of HIV infection. Older patients have a higher likelihood of having ADC. The frequency of HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy (HPE) as an initial AIDS-defining illness in children is 12-67%. In untreated children, the prevalence of HPE is about 50%. In one study of HIV encephalopathy in children with HIV infection who are receiving HAART, the rate of active HPE in the year 2000 was 1.6% and the prevalence of arrested HPE was 10%. HPE relapse occurred in 23% of the sample group with previously arrested HPE. [ 28]  International statistics Globally, 33.3 million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS in 2009. [ 6]  Of those people, only 2 million had access to HAART, because they lived in developed countries. The Australian AIDS surveillance data demonstrate a pre- to post-HAART decline in the incidence of ADC of 135 reported cases in 1993-1995 to 119 cases in 1996-2000. In the same intervals, its prevalence increased from 5.2% to 6.8% because ADC patients live longer with HAART. Not surprisingly, survival of those with ADC and advanced AIDS (CD4 +  count < 100 cells/mL) increased, from 5 months pre-HAART to 38.5 months post-HAART. [ 29]  In a study of patients with HIV in a Ugandan clinic, the prevalence of ADC was 31%. [ 30]  If extrapolated to sub-Saharan Africa (26 million people with HIV out of 40.3 million people infected worldwide), ADC would be the most important cause of dementia in persons younger than 40 years. The incidence of AIDS dementia is low when access to health care is good; risk factors include non-use of HAART and low CD4 +  counts. [ 31]  Prognosis AIDS dementia complex (ADC) has a variable progression. [ 32]  Without treatment, the disease typically has a rapid progression over a few months, with a mean survival rate of 3-6 months for patients with AIDS who have untreated ADC. As a result of HAART, however, the survival rate increased from 5 months in 1993-94 to 38.5 months in the 1996-2000 period. [ 20]  Cognitive improvement is observed in patients with ADC after the initiation of HAART. Poorer prognosis has been associated with the following: Lower educational levels Older age Lower CD4 +  counts and higher HIV RNA levels Decreased hemoglobin level Reduced platelet count Thrush Low body mass index More constitutional symptoms Hepatitis C virus co-infection One study showed that injection drug use and the presence of psychomotor slowing are associated with rapid progression of the dementia. ADC may remain static or may fluctuate. It may improve with medical therapy, or it may worsen abruptly with severe metabolic disorders (eg, hypoxemia, pneumonia) and then improve with the resolution of the metabolic disorders. In a study of 329 HIV-positive patients who had CD4 +  cell counts of less than 200/mL, or less than 300/mL with ADC, ADC was an independent predictor of time to death. [ 33]  Poor medication adherence may have been a factor. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) levels were also associated with time to death. Minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD) in HIV-infected patients may be considered a chronic condition. However, it may progress to a more severe dementia. In children treated with HAART, HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy is infrequent and largely reversible. If control of the virus is lost, relapse may occur. Patient Education Educate the patient at an early stage, and discuss future medicolegal implications of dementia. The patient should be strongly encouraged to prepare a living will or to assign power of attorney. Educate patients and families about the persistent dangers of the transmission of HIV. The following Web sites can be referenced for further information: National Institutes of Health - HIV Infection and AIDS: An Overview Centers for Disease Control and Prevention –  HIV/AIDS UCSF Center for HIV Information - HIV Transmission and Prevention in Adolescents Education of family members, friends, and caregivers of a patient with ADC is of great importance. HIV dementia is a multifaceted problem, and caregivers should know about the complications, including psychiatric complications. Often, friends and family need counseling and support to deal with this chronic and difficult condition. For patient education information, see the  Dementia Center ,  Immune System Center , and  Sexually Transmitted Diseases Center , as well as  Dementia Due to HIV Infection ,  Dementia Overview , and  HIV/AIDS . Clinical Presentation Currently, it is estimated that nearly half of all the patients with HIV infection demonstrate lower than expected performance in various neuropsychological assessments compared with healthy individuals matched for age, race, education, and ethnicity. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, depression, anxiety, and psychosis are commonly seen in these individuals. Significant memory impairment is also seen in these individuals. Personality changes, including social withdrawal and, in some extreme cases, vegetative state and mutism, is also seen. Not all patients with HAND progress to HAD. The onset of HAD is correlated with high viral loads and the duration of the infection itself. With the use of HAART, a milder form of cognitive dysfunction, minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD) has become common. MCMD accounts for approximately 30% of patients with HIV infection, while HAD accounts for less than 10%. Cognitive assessment in patients with HAD demonstrates deficits in memory, abstraction, verbal fluency, decision-making, and attention. Rare features include sleep disturbances, psychosis (with mania), and seizures. Motor problems include imbalance, clumsiness, and weakness. Early signs and symptoms are subtle and may be overlooked. Consequently, cognitive screening tests should be part of the routine care of HIV-infected patients, especially those at high risk, as indicated by older age, high plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels, low CD4 +  cell counts, hepatitis C, and poor baseline cognitive status. In minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD), activities of daily living are only mildly impaired. This contrasts with the significant impairment seen in ADC. In infants with HPE, characteristic features include decline in intellectual and motor milestones. In young children, the rate of acquisition of new skills decreases, and fine motor ability and dexterity may become impaired. Feeding difficulties may develop. In older children and adolescents, the presentation is similar to that of ADC in adults. Physical Examination The examination for ADC includes a full Mental Status Examination (MSE), a general neurologic examination, and a general physical examination. The patient should then be referred to a neuropsychologist for complete neuropsychological testing addressing specific domains. Some patients with HIV can become depressed, suicidal, and homicidal. Therefore, a thorough psychiatric assessment should also be performed at each visit. In the early stage, findings from the MSE and the general neurologic examination are normal. MSE findings are abnormal if the patient exhibits inattention, impaired concentration (eg, digit span, serial  7'  s), memory loss (eg, recalling 3 objects at 5 min), slowed verbal responses, and a blunted affect. Early on, the neurologic examination may be normal or reveal subtle impairment of rapid limb and eye movements. In more severe cases, the neurologic examination shows frontal release signs, slowed rapid movements, antisaccadic eye movements, incoordination, abnormal gait, hyperreflexia, hypertonia, extensor-plantar response weakness, and peripheral neuropathy. [ 7]  Cortical signs, including apraxia, aphasia, and agnosia, typically are absent. The terminal stage of ADC, after progression over several months, includes severe psychomotor retardation and dementia, apraxia, paraparesis, and akinetic mutism. Death ensues within a few months of reaching this stage. Seizures are rare and warrant exclusion of other conditions. Diagnostic Criteria ADC encompasses cognitive deficits, behavioral changes, and motor involvement. Affected persons may manifest deficits in each of the 3 aspects at varying severity; thus, some patients may present primarily with cognitive changes, such as slowed processing of information, captured by neuropsychological testing; others may present with behavioral problems; and still others may be have a chief complaint of motor symptoms, such as unsteady gait, tremor, or weakness. In 1991, the American Academy of Neurology defined neurocognitive deficits seen with HIV as HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and MCMD. Criteria for the diagnosis of HAD included cognitive deficits in 2 or more cognitive domains that cause impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) and an abnormality in either motor or neurobehavioral function. Patients with MCMD were defined as having decreased function in 2 cognitive or behavioral domains but without severe enough impairment to meet criteria for HAD. In 2007, Antinori et al proposed more refined criteria for diagnosing cognitive impairment associated with HIV. They proposed 3 entities: asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), HIV-associated mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Standardized neuropsychological testing was required to assess the following domains of cognition: language, attention, executive function, memory, speed of information processing, and perceptual and motor skills. In order to meet diagnostic criteria for ANI, MND, or HAD, patients must have no other etiology of dementia and must not have the confounding effect of substance use or psychiatric illness. [ 34]  ANI was proposed on the basis of experience with patients who had declines in their performance on formal neuropsychological testing but had no functional impairment in daily activities. One standard deviation (SD) below the mean for age and education appropriate norms in at least 2 of at least 5 tested domains in formal testing is diagnostic of ANI. Patients with MND meet the criteria for ANI, except that they also have impairment with ADL as reported by patient or by a corroborator. HAD can be diagnosed if patients score 2 SDs below the mean in at least 2 cognitive domains and have marked impairment in ADL as a result of cognitive decline. This proposed change improves the sensitivity of diagnosis of cognitive decline in HIV. However, ADC remains the term most widely used in the literature. Staging of AIDS Dementia Complex Price and Brew in 1988 outlined a clinical staging of ADC, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering rating scale. [ 35]  Currently, it is used mostly as a research instrument. Stage 0 In stage 0 (normal), mental and motor functions are normal. In stage 0.5 (equivocal/subclinical), symptoms may be absent, minimal, or equivocal, with no impairment of work or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). Mild signs (snout response, slowed ocular or extremity movements) may be present, but gait and strength are normal. Stage 1 In stage 1 (mild), the patient is able to perform all but the more demanding aspects of work or ADL but has unequivocal evidence of functional, intellectual, or motor impairment. Signs or symptoms may include diminished performance on neuropsychological testing. Patient can walk without assistance. Stage 2 In stage 2 (moderate), the patient is able to perform basic activities of self-care but cannot work or maintain the more demanding aspects of daily life. The patient is ambulatory but may require a single prop. Stage 3 In stage 3 (severe), the patient has major intellectual incapacity (cannot follow news or personal events, cannot sustain complex conversation, shows considerable slowing of all outputs). Motor disability precludes walking unassisted (ie, without walker or personal support); walking is usually slowed and accompanied by clumsiness of arms. Stage 4 In stage 4 (end stage), the patient is in a nearly vegetative state. Intellectual and social comprehension and output are at a rudimentary level. The patient is nearly or absolutely mute. The patient is paraparetic or paraplegic, with urinary and fecal incontinence. Neurologic Examination in Pediatric Patients In neonates, the physical examination findings are often normal. Although the age of onset is usually in the first year of life, manifestations may not be noticeable until age 2-3 years. At this time, children may present with cognitive impairment, masklike facies, acquired microcephaly, and pseudobulbar and corticospinal tract signs. Common findings in older children and adolescents are impaired attention, decreased linguistic and scholastic performance, psychomotor slowing, emotional lability, and social withdrawal. Examination findings are similar to those in adults with ADC. Criteria for HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy The American Academy of Neurology defines HPE as the presence, for at least 2 months, of at least one of the following progressive findings in a pediatric patient with no concurrent illness, other than HIV infection, that could explain the findings [ 8]  : Failure to attain, or loss of, develop­mental milestones or loss of intel­lectual ability verified by standard developmental or neuropsychologi­cal tests Acquired microcephaly as dem­onstrated by head circumference measurement or brain atrophy on serial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging in children younger than 2 years of age Acquired symmetrical motor deficits manifested by 2 or more of the fol­lowing: paresis, pathological reflexes, ataxia or gait disturbance Differential Diagnosis Dementia due to HIV disease is a diagnosis of exclusion. The differential diagnosis includes the following: Alzheimer Disease Frontal and Temporal Lobe Dementia HIV-1 Associated Opportunistic Infections: Cytomegalovirus Encephalitis Multiple Sclerosis Multiple System Atrophy Neurosyphilis Parkinson Disease Parkinson-Plus Syndromes Pick Disease Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in HIV Other problems to be considered in the differential diagnosis include the following: Cerebral lymphoma CNS infections (eg, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, neurosyphilis) Metabolic encephalopathies Depression Psychoactive drugs Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Toxic-metabolic states (eg, alcoholism, vitamin B-12 deficiency, thyroid disorders, adverse medication effects, drug interaction, recreational drug use) Antiretroviral medications can sometimes have neurocognitive side effects (eg, efavirenz therapy can result in depression, insomnia, and decreased neuropsychological testing). [ 36]  Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) Clinical worsening may be observed in patients with HIV soon after initiation of HAART therapy, due to mounting of a significant inflammatory response. This is seen even while a patient’s CD4 +  count improves and viral load dramatically decreases. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may actually worsen ADC and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. [ 37]  ADC can be distinguished from IRIS by the speed of onset. ADC is subacute to chronic, whereas IRIS can be more acute to subacute. ADC occurs in the setting of untreated, progressive AIDS, whereas IRIS begins with the start of treatment. Distinguishing between the 2 is important, because the treatment is different. ADC requires HAART with high penetration into the CNS. IRIS should be treated with steroids, depending on its severity. A new entity termed encephalitis with CD8 cell infiltration has been identified in patients with latent or inactive HIV infection of the brain due to restoration of T-cell function with HAART, leading to an intense inflammatory reaction with an influx of CD8 +  lymphocytes. The influx of the CD8 cells may cause macrophage activation and control of infection but can also present with a subacute or acute encephalopathy. The imbalance between CD8 + /CD4 +  cells may cause worsening of the HIV encephalopathy and can also produce an acute demyelinating process similar to multiple sclerosis or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. These cases may represent a specific clinicopathological entity, of which a few comparable cases have been already described. They can be included in the wide framework of immune reconstitution disease. Such syndromes have been described with opportunistic infections, but only rarely with HIV infection of the CNS. [ 38]  In a report of 14 patients treated with glucocorticosteroids, therapeutic response varied from excellent, with no sequelae (n=5), to moderate, with cognitive disorders (n=4). The mean survival time was 8 years; however, 5 patients died within 13 months of the initiation of treatment. Overview of Workup The workup for AIDS dementia complex (ADC) includes lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, neuroimaging studies, and neuropsychological testing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the first-choice neuroimaging modality. Electroencephalography (EEG) reveals generalized slowing in the later stages of ADC; this is a nonspecific finding. Brain biopsy is not recommended for corroboration, but biopsy material obtained for other reasons may confirm this diagnosis. Draw peripheral blood for syphilis serology testing, thyroid studies, routine electrolyte levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine determination, and a drug screen to effectively exclude other metabolic and infectious etiologies. Vitamin B-12 and folic acid levels should be determined and, if necessary, corrected (see  Vitamin B-12 Associated Neurological Diseases ). In cases of borderline low B-12 levels, homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are better indicators of a deficiency. An assay for anti-parietal cell or anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and a Schilling test may be indicated. Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis CSF markers are helpful in early dementia, when the diagnosis may be confusing. These markers, including neopterin, quinolinic acid, certain cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor–alpha, interleukin 1, interleukin 6), and antibodies to gp120 (eg, HIV viral envelope protein), correlate with the severity of dementia, but they are only research tools and therefore are not widely available. The axonal neurofilament light chain protein and neuronal protein Tau are frequently elevated in the CSF of patients with HAD. These proteins sometimes can be seen even before HAD develops and normalize with treatment. Neopterin, MCP-1, and CSF viral load can be used to assess the effect of treatment on viral replication. CSF beta-2 microglobulin, an immune activation marker, is a more specific CSF marker and has a positive predictive value of 88% if levels are higher than 3.8 mg/dL. CSF beta-2 microglobulin levels were found to be twice as high in patients who cognitively improved with HAART than in those who did not, indicating that CNS inflammation plays a major role in reversible neurocognitive deficits. Patients with HIV dementia have elevated levels of certain matrix metalloproteins in the CSF, but the clinical significance of these proteins is unclear. Beta-amyloid(1-42) measurements in CSF of patients with HIV who are cognitively impaired are similar to patients with mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Normal or slightly depressed CSF tau and p-tau181 measurements distinguish patients with HIV-associated cognitive impairment from patients with DAT. [ 39]  Other CSF findings are as follows: Elevated protein (60%) and immunoglobulin G (80%) Oligoclonal bands are sometimes present CSF is usually acellular, but a mononuclear pleocytosis is found in 25% HIV antibodies are present HIV frequently is cultured from CSF or detected by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, HIV-1 virus is present in CSF in the absence of neurologic abnormalities. CSF HIV RNA levels do not correlate with neuropsychological impairment; rather, plasma levels are a better correlation. CSF studies to help exclude CNS infection include the following: Cryptococcal antigen Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-abs) Cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test Depending on the clinical picture, PCR studies may also be obtained for herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses and JC virus (the causative agent of  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ). Neuroimaging Computed tomography (CT) and MRI studies of the brain can support a diagnosis of ADC and rule out other neurologic opportunistic infections or neoplasms. CT can reveal diffuse cortical atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and increased white matter signal in later stages (see the image below). Basal ganglia calcifications are seen in adults but are more common in children. Neuroimaging results may be normal in minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD). HIV-1 encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex. CT scan of the brain of a patient with AIDS... HIV-1 encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex. CT scan of the brain of a patient with AIDS dementia complex (ADC) shows diffuse atrophy and ventricular enlargement and attenuation of periventricular white matter.  Primary infection of the CNS may lead to focal white spots in the white matter on MRI. These resemble white matter abnormalities seen in various other settings such as advanced age, diabetes, and hypertension and should be interpreted with caution. Some degree of atrophy occurs during the latent stage, and, with ongoing disease activity, evidence of interstitial fluid accumulation can be seen that is more pronounced around the ventricles, in the form of hyperintense signals on T2-weighted images (see the image below). HIV-1 encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex. T2-weighted MRI shows ventricular enlargement... HIV-1 encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex. T2-weighted MRI shows ventricular enlargement and large areas of hyperintense signal in the subcortical white matter of both frontal lobes.  Differential diagnosis includes multiple sclerosis (MS) and small-vessel disease. Functional MRI Functional MRI studies are not yet widely available, but they may demonstrate abnormalities in regional brain activation during working memory tasks before mild dementia can be detected by clinical or neuropsychological evaluation. [ 40]  Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a functional imaging technique that measures brain metabolites. In persons with ADC, neuronal injury is confirmed by finding lower  N  -acetyl aspartate (NA) levels (a marker of neuronal metabolism) in the frontal white matter. [ 41]  In the basal ganglia and white matter, where gliosis and inflammatory changes are noted, the level of choline-containing metabolites, which is a marker of glial metabolism, is increased. In the future, proton MRS could be used to follow the effectiveness of CNS-targeted therapies for ADC. Chang et al showed that even in the asymptomatic stage of ADC, MRS demonstrates metabolite changes in the basal ganglia and frontal white matter. In the absence of clinically recognizable symptoms, elevated glial marker, myoinositol-to-creatinine ratio (MI/Cr), is seen in the white matter, indicating early HIV brain disease. [ 42,  43]  Patients with ADC have elevated MI/Cr and choline-to-creatinine ratio (Cho/Cr) in the basal ganglia and white matter, relative to the asymptomatic group. However, compared with controls, patients with ADC have decreased NA/Cr ratio, which is a neuronal marker. The decreased NA/Cr ratio in ADC is more profound in younger persons. This indicates that in older individuals, the metabolic changes seen may be a combination of age and HIV infection. [ 42,  43]  Research imaging tools Position emission tomography (PET) may reveal abnormalities in cortical metabolism. This method is not widely available and is most useful as a research tool. PET scanning may also be useful in very difficult cases to help exclude CNS lymphoma, which shows increased uptake, whereas the lesions of AIDS dementia do not. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may reveal abnormalities in cerebral blood flow. This method is most useful for research rather than as a routine diagnostic tool. Electroencephalography Patients with subclinical seizures may present with symptoms that mimic dementia. Consider performing an EEG to help exclude this type of pseudodementia. EEG findings may be normal in early dementia or may demonstrate diffuse slowing. However, this finding is nonspecific and is present in persons with dementia from any cause (even a metabolic one); therefore, it does not help in making an etiologic diagnosis. Neuropsychological Testing Neuropsychological testing can be used for early screening of asymptomatic, high-risk patients (eg, those with high viral load and low CD4 count [ 44]  ) and for follow-up evaluations of patients with ADC. It has a place in both clinical and research settings. Formal neuropsychological testing results may be normal in MCMD. Early in ADC, impairment of working memory is noted in bedside testing such as digit and word reversals and serial sevens. In the early stages of the disease, mental status examination findings may be entirely normal. In such cases, neuropsychological testing is especially useful and can help to detect mild, early cognitive abnormalities. This testing can help to quantify and determine the specific pattern of the cognitive abnormality. Specialists use several neuropsychiatric screening techniques; the most widely accepted is the modified HIV dementia scale, although this scale has been found to be sensitive only for the most severe forms of impairment. The scale consists of 4 subsets that target memory (eg, recall, registration), psychomotor speed, constructional ability, and concentration. A total of 12 points can be earned, and a score lower than 6 points is considered abnormal. The test takes 10 minutes to administer and can be given by a nonneurologist. These tests are useful diagnostic adjuncts, but the results cannot solely determine the presence of ADC. Because false-negatives can occur with screening tests, a patient with a negative screening test may require more in-depth neuropsychological testing. [ 45]  In advancing disease, tests that explore the following abilities may be helpful: Motor ability (ie, Finger Tapping Test, Grooved Pegboard Test) Concentration (ie, Continuous Performance Test, Trail Making Test A and B) Processing (ie, Trail Making Test A and B, Choice Reaction Time) Memory/learning (ie, Weschler Memory Scale, California Verbal Learning Test) Abstraction (ie, Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test) Speech/language (ie, Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency Test) Histologic Findings The hallmark is HIV encephalitis in the white and subcortical gray matter. These changes are noted in 20-90% of patients. Some patients with ADC show only minimal changes. Atrophy is typically in a frontotemporal distribution. Diffuse myelin pallor may be present but is more commonly due to changes in the blood-brain barrier than to demyelination. Vacuolation may be observed. Cortical neuronal loss is noted in 18-50% of patients. Subcortical neuronal loss (substantia nigra) is noted in 25%. Reduced synaptic density and dendritic arborization may be observed. Some neurons and astrocytes appear to die by apoptosis. Brain tissue may be infiltrated by microglia, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells (see the images below). Activated glial cells are twice as numerous in brains of patients with AIDS as in brains of controls. Microgliosis may be diffuse or form clumps or nodules, often in a perivascular pattern in the white and subcortical gray matter. Infected cells are associated consistently with macrophages/microglia and endothelial cells. Less commonly observed are astrocytes and neurons with restricted expression of HIV genes.

Antiretroviral and Other Therapies Currently, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the cornerstone of treatment for HIV-related cognitive disorders. Aggressive early treatment of patients with HIV disease with antiviral medications and early suppression of viral replication prevents most of the devastating consequences of HIV dementia. [ 46]  Several studies have shown that early and aggressive treatment of HIV infection decreases the rate of dementia from greater than 50% to 10%. Multiple studies have shown that patients on HAART show partial reversals of neuropsychological deficits and significant improvement, which is sustained, whereas patients not on HAART steadily decline. [ 47]  HAART protects against and induces remission and decreases the incidence of AIDS dementia complex (ADC) and HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy (HPE). Early and continuous viral suppression with HAART is associated with improved performance on neuropsychological testing. However, some patients, despite adequate control of the disease, develop ADC. One theory proposes the poor CNS penetration of the antiretroviral drugs as the reason for the progression to ADC. The Cerebral Penetration Effective Index (CPE) has been proposed for estimating the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs in the CNS. Other authors suggest that this may be secondary to other comorbid conditions such as socioeconomic conditions, drug abuse, head trauma, and literacy. Most of the 26 antiretroviral medications used to treat HIV have poor cerebrospinal fluid–to-plasma drug ratios, indicating poor CNS penetration. Exceptions include  stavudine ,  abacavir ,  nevirapine , and  zidovudine  (ZDV). However, whether this translates into poor drug levels in CNS tissue and whether drug penetrance is clinically important remain unclear. [ 48]  In the absence of more data, no general recommendation exists to change a patient’s HAART regimen to agents with higher CSF penetrance based on cognitive status. [ 26]  A broad range of nano medicines is being developed to improve drug delivery to the CNS. These nano technology–based methods include disruption of blood brain barrier (BBB), development of nano particles with improved BBB permeability, uptake by brain microvascular endothelial cells via adsorptive mediated transcytosis, and cell-mediated delivery. HAART-related reversal of some of the neurologic deficits of ADC, with patients showing improvements in motor and psychomotor speed, has been seen to be independent of CNS penetration of specific antiretroviral drugs. When treatment fails and virologic rebound occurs, cognitive function deteriorates. Optimal doses in the presence of ADC remain unclear. If ADC develops during treatment with antiretroviral agents, additional or alternative agents should be tried. Clinical trails have been performed using various agents with different mechanisms of action, such as MAO-B inhibitors, antioxidants, anticonvulsants ( valproic acid ), NMDA receptor antagonists ( memantine ), and other peptides, but none of them showed benefit over that conferred by HAART alone. A clinical trail of  minocycline  is underway. Minocycline has been shown to have neuroprotective and antiinflammatory action and was able to inhibit protein kinases in apoptotic pathways. It is shown to inhibit microglial activation, release of reactive oxygen species, and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Sometimes, depression and behavioral disturbances such as hallucinations or delusions require pharmacotherapy. However, caution is required when patients with ADC are treated with psychoactive drugs, such as antidepressants, antiepileptics, neuroleptics, and anxiolytics, because of enhanced susceptibility to sedative properties and possible paradoxical reactions. Such symptoms should be treated cooperatively by specialists in internal medicine, neurology, and psychiatry. Furthermore, physicians must remember that many drugs can upregulate the metabolism of HAART drugs, thus reducing its bioavailability. Metabolic causes of cognitive decline, such as other infections, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid dysfunction, and liver and renal dysfunction, should be corrected in consultation with internal medicine specialists. Case reports and small experimental studies have shown that stimulants and L-deprenyl may be helpful for attention and memory deficits. Nutritional therapies may be considered as potential interventions in the follow-up care for patients with cognitive motor symptoms associated with HIV infection. Oxidative free-radical scavengers, such as  vitamin E , the experimental antioxidant OPC-4117, and the trace mineral and antioxidant  selenium , may prove therapeutically useful. Future trials might include monoclonal antibodies against interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Follow-up Patients need close follow-up because of progressive dementia, unavoidable polypharmacy with possibly toxic drug levels (in particular, free drug levels), and possible development of seizures and psychosis. Patients may become incapable of self-care and require hospice care. HIV RNA levels and CD4 +  T-cell counts should be evaluated periodically to monitor clinical response and treatment resistance. HIV RNA serum levels generally reflect CSF levels until late in disease when different HIV strains may be present. [ 49]  Neuropsychological testing is a more sensitive method of following cognitive changes than a simple neurologic examination. Serial testing should be performed at regular intervals to monitor for improvement in scores and responses to therapy. Radiologic follow-up with serial neuroimaging (ie, MRI) at regular intervals is a useful follow-up tool. These test results show decreased brain atrophy and improvement in white matter changes if the patient is responding to antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral medications should be continued indefinitely in essentially all cases. Depending on the severity and manifestations of ADC, patients may require nursing home placement. The severely demented and emaciated patient is at risk for decubitus ulcers. Psychotic features of ADC may require psychiatric consultation. Although seizures are rare, their management is difficult, because several antiseizure drugs affect blood levels of antiretroviral drugs. Patient Competence and Decision Making An important aspect of managing health care for the patient with HIV is to discuss the issue of cognitive decline. Patients should be strongly encouraged to prepare a living will or assign power of attorney early in their disease process. In cases where HIV-associated dementia is established, addressing issues of competence to make medical decisions is also important. Patients may at times reject treatment offered by a physician, even at the risk of remaining ill. A person’s right to autonomy cannot be challenged, provided that he or she has the competence to understand the risks and benefits of the treatment offered. Competence to consent to medical treatment is defined as the “mental capacity necessary to comprehend the risks and benefits of a proposed medical treatment and its alternatives.” The only exception to this situation would be a medical emergency in which the hospital or physician may obtain consent from a surrogate, a close family member, or a spouse. The health-care provider may then render care in the patient’s best interest and treat the medical emergency. In a psychiatric setting, competence is considered as “the ability to understand and appreciate those duties to society owed by an ordinary citizen to reasonable prudence and care.” This is pertinent for patients with HIV-associated dementia who, due to their severe neurocognitive impairment, may be unable to provide for themselves and may endanger themselves or others. The law permits custodial detention and involuntary hospitalization in such cases. Only a county mental health professional psychiatric crisis team, state-designated mental health professional, or peace officer can authorize involuntary hospitalization. Within 72 hours, the patient must be evaluated for mental capacity and grave disability. Grave disability is determined by the ability of the person to provide basic food, clothing, and shelter for himself or herself. If the patient is determined to be gravely disabled, the hold can be extended for 14 days, and the superior court can be petitioned for appointment of a conservator. HIV-associated dementia may jeopardize the patient’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. In such cases, the clinician has a duty to advise both the patient and the Department of Motor Vehicles that it is unsafe for the patient to drive. Some patients may have severe sensory loss related to HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy and thus may be unsafe to drive on that basis. The health care provider's direct responsibility is to report such patients to the Department of Motor Vehicles as being potentially unsafe drivers. [ 7]  Consultations The care of patients with ADC is best accomplished with a team approach, drawing upon the expertise of specialists in various fields. A specialist with expertise in HIV (an infectious diseases or general practice physician) should oversee the antiretroviral regimen. Like all patients with HIV disease, patients with ADC require a HAART regimen that is clinically, virologically, and immunologically effective. Psychiatric consultation is often indicated, as patients with ADC commonly exhibit agitation, anxiety, fatigue, depression, and other psychiatric manifestations. Mania and psychosis have been described as presenting symptoms or complications of ADC. Consultation with a psychiatrist may be required to discuss appropriate use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, or stimulants. Psychotherapy may be helpful for patients with mild-to-moderate dementia to help them understand, mourn, and adapt to this new impairment in functioning. As the population of patients with HIV ages, dementia is a risk, because it occurs late in life; older patients with HIV may develop Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or Alzheimer disease unrelated to HIV. A neurologic workup by a neurologist specializing in neurobehavioral disorders may help to sort out the etiology of cognitive impairment. The physical therapist and occupational therapist each plays a vital role in trying to maximize the functional capacity of the patient. HIV-1 encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex.

				"body": "Overview Background Blood and any body fluid visibly contaminated with blood should be considered capable of transmitting  hepatitis B virus  (HBV),  hepatitis C virus  (HCV), and  human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV). Semen and vaginal secretions should also be considered potentially able to transmit these viruses. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, pleural fluid, synovial fluid, and peritoneal and pericardial fluids carry a significant risk of transmitting these viruses. In contrast, unless blood is visibly present, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, feces, nasal secretions, urine, and vomitus carry a very low risk of transmission of HCV and HIV. It should be noted that saliva can also carry HBV. [ 1]  (See Pathophysiology.) Occupational transmission of  blood-borne infections  may also occur through parenteral, mucous membrane, and non-intact skin exposure. The greatest risk for transdermal transmission is via a skin penetration injury that is fairly deep and sustained with a sharp hollow-bore needle that has visible blood on it that had recently been removed from a blood vessel of a patient with a high viral load. [ 2]  Although many infectious agents may be transmitted by such contact, the most consequential include HBV, HCV, and HIV. (See Pathophysiology and Prognosis.) In addition, skin and soft-tissue infection at the site of the inoculation, through introduction of staphylococcal species, is an issue of concern and must not be neglected. Tetanus prophylaxis is also an important issue of concern. Another important issue is the fact that many medical institutions adopt clinical pathways, algorithms, and plans for management of their own health care personnel but are woefully lacking when faced with the outside individual at significant risk for these diseases from needlesticks, mucous membrane splashes, or sexual encounters. (See Treatment and Medication.) Health care personnel include employees, volunteers, attending clinicians, students, contractors, and any public safety workers whose activities involve contact with patients and their environment such that exposure to blood or other body fluids can occur. Nurses, trainees, and students are at especially high risk for significant morbidity from these exposures. [ 3,  4,  5]  Non–health care personnel may be exposed by way of social interaction, sexual encounters (including sexual assault), trauma scenarios, intentional inoculations consistent with contemporary terrorist activity, or drug abuse. A flow chart for the management of body fluid exposure is shown below. Flowsheet for management of blood/body fluid exposures.  Flowsheet for management of blood/body fluid exposures.  Infection risk Body fluid exposures carry a risk of transmitting HIV, HBV, and HCV. The risk of developing HIV after a needlestick injury involving an HIV-infected patient is around 0.3%. Factors that increase the odds of HIV transmission after percutaneous exposure include a deep injury, the presence of visible blood on the instrument causing the exposure, injury via a needle that was placed in a vein or artery of the source patient, and terminal illness in the source patient. [ 6,  7]  Viral titers are also very high during the initial stages of infection, when seroconversion is taking place. [ 8]  Wearing gloves may reduce (>50%) the volume of blood introduced through an injury. (See Prognosis.) Note that the risk of HIV transmission in health care workers from exposure of the mucosa to HIV-infected fluids was extremely low (0.09%) and that no cases of HIV conversion after exposure of intact skin to HIV-contaminated fluids or from bites (unless visible blood was present) were reported. [ 9]  Pathophysiology When intact, the integumentary system serves as an effective physical barrier to the entry of infectious elements into the body. However, a special situation exists in terms of mucous membranes. Across these membranes lies a layer of mucus secreted by specialized columnar cells that are closely associated with each other through gap junctions. These junctions are little more than specialized cell surface projections that allow intercellular communication. The presence of a moist mucous layer tends to prolong the viability of fragile viruses, such as HIV and HBV, which cannot survive long in drier environments. However, HBV has been found to be capable of surviving on countertops for 7 days and remain capable of causing infection, [ 10]  while HCV has been shown to be able to survive on environmental surfaces for a minimum of 16 hours, but not for as long as 4 days. [ 11]  Higher vascularity coupled with a relatively permeable cellular layer gives rise to a presumed heightened risk of transmission of HBV, HCV, or HIV across mucous membranes and into the bloodstream. After initial exposure, animal models have shown that HIV replicates within dendritic cells of the skin and mucosa within the first 48 hours before spreading through lymphatic vessels and becoming a systemic infection. This interval from initial introduction of the virus to systemic spread provides an opportunity to inhibit the replication of the virus using PEP. [ 12]  In addition, some individuals who are exposed to HIV or HCV may have the ability to clear these infections due to inherent cellular immunity and may not demonstrate an antibody response to these organisms. This is referred to as aborted infection. [ 8]  Fortunately, viral transmission is rare in cases of occupational HIV exposures. Intact keratinized skin does not possess the mucous membrane characteristics that encourage the transmission of HIV, and it is virtually impermeable unless disrupted. Etiology Most exposures are caused by a departure from universal precautions on some level, whether they are the result of recapping or of failure to use personal protective equipment or are due to a sharp unintentionally left in an inappropriate place or placed in the wrong container for disposal. (See Presentation.) Blood exposure is a particularly high risk during surgical procedures (up to 6.3 exposures per 1000 surgical procedures). Risk factors for blood exposure during surgical procedures increase with higher levels of patient blood loss, longer procedure duration, higher number of surgical personnel involved in the procedure, and the use of suture needles rather than other device types. The use of blunt surgical needles, when appropriate, reduced the risk of blood exposure from needlesticks, as did the use of double gloving for certain procedures. [ 13]  It has also been recommended that oculofacial plastic surgeons strongly consider using eye protection during procedures that have the potential to cause “splash exposures.\" [ 14]  Although the incidence of body fluid exposures and percutaneous injuries have been significantly reduced overall, likely owing to safety-engineered devices, these devices are still associated with a significant number of percutaneous injuries. More prevention strategies and education are still needed in this area. [ 15]  One strategy that may help prevent these injuries is calling a “surgical time out” and making a “high-risk announcement” when there is a high risk of needlestick injuries during a surgical procedure. Procedures that were found to be high risk included administering skin injections, placing intravenous catheters, drawing blood, recapping needles, and using sharp suture needles. [ 16]  Safety during autopsies is another subject that has not received much publicity. The “Autopsy Checklist” is a standardized way of documenting safety and risk management issues during the autopsy process. However, the effectiveness of this procedure relies on the accurate completion of this list, which often goes undone. [ 17]  Recently, because of the Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, there has been a great deal of publicity concerning the use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Unfortunately, no high-quality studies have addressed which types of equipment protect best, the best way to don and doff the PPE, and how to ensure that healthcare workers (HCWs), who are at a higher risk of these diseases than the general population, should use them properly. It appears that more active training on the use of PPE is needed by HCWs. [ 18]  One method for studying the effectiveness of PPE, along with the best way to don and doff this equipment by providers, is by using UV tracers. [ 19]  When dealing with blood and body fluid exposures, document whether the exposure represents a departure from universal precautions or Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards or whether it represents a true accident (eg, projectile vomiting, precipitous labor with spontaneous rupture of membranes). This information is vital to the institutional safety committee, whose function is to monitor the safety of the environment for the entire facility and make recommendations for upgrades and policy changes. Epidemiology In the United States, sharps injuries occur at a rate of 1.8 per year per physician and 0.98 per year per nurse while working on the same medical ward. Statistically, however, twice as many nurses as doctors have been reported with occupationally acquired HIV infection. Whether this is a function of the significance of the exposure (ie, severity of the stick) or the route of exposure remains to be studied. In a retrospective study of first responders presenting to an ED for body fluid or blood exposure, the incidence was 23.29 ED visits per 100,000 ambulance runs. [ 20]  Body fluid exposures appear to be a significant problem in developing countries, but no reliable statistics are available. Prognosis Prognosis is associated with risk of infection and its sequelae. This is difficult to specify in any given patient. However, since the risk of HIV transmission is less than 1%, the prognosis of any given patient exposed to HIV may be listed as good but may remain so only with vigilant follow-up and consistent use of prophylaxis against infection. Patients who develop hepatitis or HIV infection face significant morbidity and mortality. However, meaningful treatments now exist for HIV, HBV, and HCV infections. Morbidity and mortality Health care workers who have a significant exposure to HBV (ie, inoculation with an open-bore needle from a source known to have active HBV disease) but have not previously received HBV vaccine and do not receive PEP have a 6%-30% risk of becoming infected, depending on the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The HBV viral DNA level correlates better with the infectivity of HBV than does the presence of HBeAg. [ 8]  The risk of HCV transmission from a known HCV-positive source by a sharps injury is 0%-7%. Approximately 80% of those infected with HCV will develop active liver disease, and 10%-20% will develop cirrhosis; 1%-5% of cirrhosis cases will lead to liver cancer over a period of years. [ 21]  As noted above, the rate of HIV transmission from a known infected individual via a sharps injury is 0.3%, whereas that for exposure to mucous membrane is 0.09%. [ 22]  The rate is higher if the injury was sustained by a hollow-bore needle, if the injury was deeply penetrating, or if blood was injected during the injury. Risk to the injured health care worker is greater if the source patient had a high HIV viral load and/or a lower CD4 count. Complications The main complication of body fluid exposure is acquisition of hepatitis and HIV infection. Acquiring a significant bacterial skin infection from a needlestick is also possible. The risk of acquiring tetanus is extremely low. Patient Education Education regarding universal precautions and safety protocols to employees prior to any body fluid exposure may prevent exposures. Once the patient has been exposed, the patient must be educated regarding the risks, in addition to the risks versus benefits of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). If the patient opts for HIV PEP, the importance of adherence for 28 days must be emphasized. Also, the patient should understand to return to the emergency department (ED) immediately for any complications of the body fluid exposure or the PEP regimen. The importance of outpatient follow-up should be stressed to the patient. For additional patient education information, see the  Healthy Living Center  and the  Sexual Health Center , as well as  Hepatitis B ,  Hepatitis C , and  HIV/AIDS . Clinical Presentation History Patients present with a history of exposure. Typically, this is a splash-type exposure to mucosal or non-intact skin, or it is an exposure resulting from a needlestick injury to intact skin. Patients often report exposures to intact keratinized skin out of uninformed concern, or they may be aware of some preexisting injury that predisposes them to infection. Reassurance through awareness of the risks for viral transmission in various scenarios is of significant importance to the health care provider and the patient. In addition, the history should include any illnesses that may increase susceptibility to infection and/or to adverse reactions to the medications usually used for prophylaxis. The history should also include any medications the patient is taking that may interact with the PEP medications and any allergies. A history of immunizations for tetanus and HBV should be obtained. Physical Examination During the physical examination, be sure to assess the body area of exposure and the depth of any wounds. The neurovascular status in the setting of extremity wounds is an important and often omitted element. The clinician should remain suspicious of occult injury, such as paper cuts or abrasions, which may threaten the integrity of the skin. For mucosal exposures, especially on the face, keep in mind that the exposure may not be limited to only one area and may occur simultaneously in nasal, oral, and conjunctival mucosal surfaces. Workup Approach Considerations Testing for HBV surface antigen, HCV, and HIV is recommended at the time of injury. This is useful primarily as a baseline evaluation, because patients will not have undergone seroconversion in such a short time frame. Accurate results from rapid HIV tests can be available within 30 minutes, and new-generation HIV tests can detect HIV seroconversion much earlier than the standard enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA). Although a number of states require written informed consent for HIV serologic testing, in the event that a patient is unable to provide consent, some institutions allow surrogates to sign. Surrogates may be family members, legal guardians, or 2 attending physicians. When a source patient refuses to consent, some states waive the required informed consent. Many clinicians obtain routine laboratory evaluations, such as a complete blood cell (CBC) count and chemistries including liver function tests, which likely are not of much value acutely but are important as baseline values. However, sending rapid plasma reagent (RPR) to test for latent syphilis is prudent. Women of child-bearing age should be tested for pregnancy, since the result may affect which HIV PEP regimen is used. In cases of sexual exposure, tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia should also be performed. Imaging studies Acutely, imaging studies are of little use, unless the presence of a foreign body or radiopaque material is suspected. Treatment & Management Approach Considerations Infection is still a significant concern at any given exposure to body fluid, especially an exposure involving disruption of the normal integumentary barrier. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered. Prehospital Care The single most useful element in prehospital care is the limitation of exposure and immediate cleaning of the area that has been exposed. Copious amounts of soap and water are appropriate. Many health care workers use rapid acting antiseptic solutions, but while theoretically applicable, no studies support any benefit from this practice. Mucous membranes should be flushed with copious amounts of water. Emergency Department Care The treating clinician should obtain and assess potential risk factor information concerning the source patient. The clinician must also be mindful of any risks to the source patient. For example, if the source patient bit the exposed patient, the source patient may be at risk, especially if there is blood in the wound of the exposed patient. Detailed information regarding the volume of blood/body fluid transmission, duration, and extent of the exposure is also important. [ 23]  In addition, if the source patient is known to be HIV positive, a history of which antiretroviral medications are being used (as well as the patient's response to therapy, including CD4 counts and viral load data, if known) should be obtained, as this directly affects the therapy chosen for prophylaxis of the exposed individual. If a significant or highly suspicious exposure did occur and the source patient is potentially (or definitively) infected with HIV or HBV, then prophylaxis is to be offered and risk-versus-benefit counseling undertaken. Body fluid exposure management is outlined in the flow chart below. Flowsheet for management of blood/body fluid exposures.  Flowsheet for management of blood/body fluid exposures.  If it is believed that HIV prophylaxis is warranted, the patient should be given a stat dose in the ED and a prescription for the PEP regimen for 28 days. If indicated, HBIG and the HBV vaccine should be given as stat doses in the ED and follow-up doses of the vaccine given in the OPD in one month and then 6 months later. If the patient refuses the vaccine, he or she should receive another dose of HBIG one month later in the OPD. Wound management Copiously irrigate wounds with water and antiseptic soap. Copiously irrigate exposed mucous membranes with water or saline (3-6 L is a good start). Tetanus prophylaxis Administer a tetanus booster when the patient’s immunization status is not up-to-date. Pregnant patients should receive only tetanus toxoid, not a diphtheria antigen–containing product. Lavage and Wound Cleaning The single most pertinent procedure to undertake in the patient after exposure is lavage. Copious amounts of irrigation fluid are appropriate in cases of mucosal exposure (ocular and oral), as well as soap-and-water washing in cases of needlestick injury. Although no regimen has been shown to affect viral transmission rates, this is an empiric regimen aimed at decreasing the level of exposure to the viral agent in order to decrease the associated risk of transmission. Small wounds and punctures may be cleaned with an antiseptic such as an alcohol-based hand hygiene agent; alcohol is virucidal to HIV, HBV, and HCV. Other agents that inactivate HIV are iodophors, chloroxylenol, and chlorhexidine. [ 24]  HIV Prophylaxis Recommendations are that HIV prophylaxis be given within 2 hours of the exposure, when possible. Therefore, the first dose should be given in the ED. The 2013 guidelines published by the US Public Health Service recommend that this treatment be started in patients with high-risk exposure that occurred within 72 hours of the ED visit. For extremely high-risk exposures, PEP may be considered even after more than 72 hours postexposure. [ 25,  7]  Treatment should be continued for 4 weeks. It is critical that the physician emphasize the importance of the patient taking the medications for the entire 28 days. Generally, most EDs stock only a limited supply of these (currently) very expensive medications. In light of this, an appropriate supply of medication is often provided to allow the patient to follow up with the occupational health service on the next available business day. In the case of exposure on a weekend or weekend/holiday, a supply to cover 3-5 days is provided. Given the risk of contracting HIV infection, it is the ethical obligation of the clinician to ensure that the patient is able to obtain enough medication to last until the follow-up visit. This should apply to not only health care workers but also non–healthcare workers who have significant exposure. Individual states may have their own medication regimen for PEP. The clinician should become familiar with his or her state’s Web site in order to determine whether his or her choice coincides with the state’s regimen. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends use of PEP based on the exposure type, with consideration of the infection status of the source. If the source’s HIV status is negative, no PEP is recommended. A positive rapid HIV test result should be confirmed with an EIA test and eventually with a Western blot test. However, a negative conventional EIA test result is enough to exclude the diagnosis of HIV unless there is clinical evidence of primary HIV infection or HIV-related disease. [ 8]  It was once believed that a source patient who tested negative for HIV might still be in the window phase (phase after HIV transmission but before detectability) and therefore could still transmit the virus via occupational exposure. However, no cases of conversions to HIV positivity have been reported in patients who had occupational exposures during the “window phase” of the source patient. If the HIV status of the source is unknown, the decision of whether to administer PEP should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with an expert, taking into account risk versus benefit. [ 25]  However, if the source is HIV-positive and the exposure is felt to be potentially significant, then PEP is recommended and should be given even if the patient was exposed to only a small volume. Per guidelines that were published by the US Public Health Service in 2013, therapy is initiated with 3 drugs for all exposures that are believed to place the patient at risk for HIV infection. No distinction is now made between low-risk exposures (which required only 2 drugs) and high-risk exposures (which required 3 drugs). [ 25]  The CDC now recommends PEP with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a protease inhibitor (PI) for all exposures in which PEP is believed to be necessary. [ 25]  The currently preferred HIV PEP drug regimen is tenofovir DF (Viread; TDF) 300 mg PO QD  plus  emtricitabine (Emtriva; TDF) 200 mg (Truvada) PO QD  plus  raltegravir (Isentress; RAL) 400 mg PO BID. Please note that Truvada is a fixed combination of tenofovir DF and emtricitabine and is given as 1 tablet QD. This is also the preferred regimen for sexual exposures, as well as needlesticks and mucous membrane exposures. [ 25]  Acceptable alternatives are as follows: Tenofovir DF 300 mg PO QD  plus  lamivudine 300 mg PO QD  plus  raltegravir 400 mg PO BID Tenofovir DF 300 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg (Truvada) 1 tab PO QD  plus  darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg PO QD Tenofovir DF 300 mg PO QD  plus  lamivudine 300 mg PO QD  plus  darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg PO QD Zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg/lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg (Combivir) 1 tab PO BID  plus  raltegravir 400 mg PO BID Zidovudine (ZDV) 600 mg/day PO divided BID/TID  plus  emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg PO QD  plus  raltegravir 400 mg PO BID Zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg/lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg BID (Combivir) 1 tab PO BID  plus  darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg PO QD Zidovudine (ZDV) 600 mg/day PO divided BID/TID  plus  emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg  plus  darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg PO QD Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, zidovudine, and lamivudine are all NRTIs. Raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir are PIs. As noted above in PEP regimens, in most cases, 2 NRTIs are paired with one PI. Other alternative regimens are also acceptable. In these alternative regimens, a different PI (eg, etravirine, rilpivirine, atazanavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir) can be used to replace raltegravir or darunavir/ritonavir in the above regimens. One of these other PIs is combined with 2 of the NRTIs in the above regimens. For more information on these regimens, the reader is referred to the Updated US Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis. Other alternative regimens also exist but should not be used without expert consultation (see Consultations). Regimens may need to be modified or alternative regimens may need to be used if the patient has comorbid conditions, if the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, if the patient is not tolerating the initial regimen, or if a medication is not available or is too expensive (see below). Older patients usually have more comorbidities than younger patients and are usually taking more medications. Elderly patients are also more likely to have adverse drug reactions. All of these factors must be taken into consideration when choosing a PEP regimen to prevent HIV. Truvada, although it has better GI tolerance than Combivir, should not be used in patients with renal failure because it may worsen renal function. The dose of Combivir should be modified in patients with renal insufficiency. Efavirenz should not be used in pregnancy, as it is teratogenic. Saquinavir/ritonavir is a cost-efficient alternative to raltegravir. The following antiretroviral agents are not recommended to be used for PEP because of their potential toxicity: Nevirapine Didanosine Nelfinavir Tipranavir High-risk exposures If the source is known to have HIV and is undergoing HIV treatment, an alternate regimen may be required because of the possibility of resistance; if possible, an HIV specialist should be consulted (see Consultations). Adherence Failure to complete courses of recommended regimens has been due to adverse effects, such as headache, diarrhea, or nausea. These symptoms can be managed with acetaminophen, antimotility and antiemetic agents. Alternatively, the dose interval of the medication (within the manufacturer’s recommendation) can be changed in order to ensure adherence to the regimen. [ 7]  Hepatitis B Prophylaxis Provide HBV immunoglobulin (HBIG) and HBV vaccine if indicated based on vaccination and immunity status. [ 26]  If the patient has received HBV vaccine in the past and has completed the full series or has a history of HBV, then nothing needs to be done acutely in the ED. Antibody titers for HBV surface antibody should be sent and urgent follow-up should be given. If the titers are less than 10 mIU/mL, indicating that the vaccine was ineffective and the patient is not immune, then the patient should be given HBIG, and the HBV revaccination series should be started. [ 27]  If the patient has not been previously fully immunized against or has not had HBV and the source is either HBsAg-positive or unknown, the patient should be given HBIG at a dose of 0.06 mL/kg intramuscularly (IM) and the HBV vaccination series should be started. If HBIG is given with the vaccine, it does not need to be repeated. If given for some reason without the vaccine, it should be repeated in 1 month. Although HBIG alone has also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing HBV transmission, it is still administered with the vaccine, since the vaccine is available and safe; HIBG gives 3-6 months of protection from HBV, while the vaccine can give lifelong protection. [ 28]  HBIG should be given as soon as possible after the exposure, preferably within a day. It probably is not effective if given more than 7 days after the exposure. In order for PEP to be effective, early administration of the initial dose of the vaccine is needed. [ 29]  The recommended series is given in 3 intramuscular doses. In adults and children, the vaccine should be administered only in the deltoid muscle; when given in the buttocks, the immunogenicity of the vaccine is lower. [ 28]  The vaccine is given in 3 doses (at 0, 1, 6 months). If the patient refuses vaccination, HBIG can be repeated in 1 month. The CDC is now recommending serologic testing for immunity 1-2 months postvaccination in health care workers who are at risk for HBV to ensure that the vaccine was effective. [ 27]  Neither pregnancy nor lactation should be considered a contraindication to vaccination in women. [ 28]  Hepatitis C Prophylaxis No effective Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved prophylaxis currently exists for HCV. Prophylactic use of interferon has not been proven effective. [ 21]  Management is expectant, with close follow-up as appropriate. If the patient develops HCV antibodies, he or she can then be treated for HCV infection by a specialist. Counseling Patients should receive immediate counseling about the risk of their exposure to infectious agents and the indications for antiviral prophylaxis. Failure to provide appropriate counseling and HBV/HIV prophylaxis when indicated could leave the ED physician vulnerable to adverse liability if the injured patient seroconverts. However, such counseling is of paramount importance not just medicolegally, but also in terms of the overall management of the exposed individual. These efforts serve to \"close the loop\" in the quest to eliminate preventable occurrences. Patients who have been exposed to HIV virus should be counseled to avoid possible transmission of the virus during the follow-up period, for example by using condoms. [ 8]  Importantly, exposure to body fluids that may carry a potentially fatal disease such as HIV infection is alarming to patients. It has been shown that body fluid exposure has negative psychological effects. It is imperative that the physician caring for such a patient be very empathetic and caring. It is not enough for the physician to treat only the exposure, but the provider must give the patient psychological support as well. Also, the physician must make certain that all necessary care and follow-up is done in an expeditious manner without any hitches. Still, one of the greatest difficulties remains in \"making the call\" as to whether an exposure warrants prophylaxis. While leaving the decision up to the patient will result in a higher than necessary rate of medication dispensing, until methods of HIV detection and management can provide greater and more timely reassurance, this will likely remain the course most practitioners will take. Pregnancy should not preclude the use of optimal regimens, and PEP should not be denied to an individual solely on the basis of pregnancy. Issues that must be discussed with a pregnant patient include HIV transmission to the fetus, the effects of the medications on the development of the fetus (the first trimester posing the maximal risk of teratogenesis), and the potential risk of fetal loss. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be sought. Patients should be referred to an appropriate and reliable site for outpatient counseling and long-term testing for seroconversion. Patients will need testing for the subsequent 6 months or, if new-generation HIV testing is used, for the subsequent 4 months. Deterrence and Prevention OSHA standards are to be encouraged and reinforced by all hospital employees consistently because prevention is the single best weapon against blood/body fluid exposures. The following universal precautions should be followed in all patient contact situations: Wash hands between care of each patient Use gloves when handling body fluids or performing procedures in which exposure is possible, including contact with mucous membranes Use protective gowns, eyewear, and masks during procedures when the risk of splash or spray of body fluids exists Never recap needles - If recapping is necessary, the cap should not be held by hand; rather, lay the cap on a firm surface and insert the needle; then, the entire system is lifted, and the cap is secured in place. OSHA requirements are now moving toward needleless and needlestick prevention systems as basic requirements in health care facilities. Institutions must evaluate these systems and utilize those that function best within their departments. As per OSHA, health institutions are required to have policies in place to decrease the risk of body fluid exposure among their employees. To the extent possible, they are also to use as many “needleless” systems as possible to prevent needlestick injuries; to educate their staff on the risks and prevention of body fluid exposures, emphasizing the need to use universal precautions at all times; and to make HBV vaccination available to all their employees at no cost. Consultations Referral to an infectious disease specialist may be warranted, especially when pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. In addition, exposures from HIV-positive sources who are undergoing treatment require further consideration for a specialized regimen for prophylaxis of exposed individuals because of demonstrated insensitivity of HIV to some agents over time. Several resources are available when the clinician is seeking consultation. Health care providers are encouraged to use consultation services such as the National Clinician's Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline, which provides advice regarding management of blood and body fluid exposures, including risk assessment, choice of PEP medications, and assistance with difficult-to-manage scenarios (eg, pregnancy). This service can be contacted toll free at (888) 448-4911. In addition, clinicians with on-site Internet access may use an ever-growing number of online resources, including the following: American Nurses Association NIOSH Alert: Preventing Needlestick Injuries in Health Care Settings National Alliance for the Primary Prevention of Sharps Injuries National Clinician’s Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Website Consultation is always available and should be used if there are any questions about what regimen to use for PEP. Most institutions have an infectious disease expert on call for this purpose; if not, the National Clinician’s Post-Exposure Hotline at telephone number (888-448-4191) is always available for consultation. Expert consultation should be obtained in the following circumstances: The patient presents more than 72 hours after the exposure The source patient is unknown (eg, a needlestick from a sharp in the sharp’s container) The exposed patient is pregnant The exposed patient is breastfeeding Suspected resistance of the source virus Toxicity of the initial PEP regimen Significant underlying disease in the exposed patient [ 25]  Long-Term Monitoring Patients receiving HIV prophylaxis should be given a follow-up appointment to an occupational health clinic (employees), an HIV/infectious disease clinic, or a primary care physician who is experienced in managing body fluid exposures within 72 hours to monitor for any adverse effects of the medications, tolerance of the regimen, and adherence. In addition, any blood tests with pending results that were sent from the ED should be checked in the clinic. For example, if the HIV test from the source patient was pending but now shows a negative result, the HIV prophylaxis regimen should be stopped if it had been initiated. Results related to hepatitis infection and immunity are usually unavailable prior to discharge from the ED, and those results may be important for ongoing treatment. For example, the source may have turned out to be positive for HBV infection, and the patient may have turned out not to be immune, but the patient was not treated in the ED with HBIG and HBV vaccine pending the results of these tests. In this case, treatment with HBIG and the vaccination series should be started. If the patient had a previous history of HBV vaccinations but the anti–HBV surface antigen antibodies now measure less than 10 mIU/mL, HBIG and HBV vaccine injection are indicated. Note that HBIG needs to be administered within 7 days of exposure for efficacy, and the sooner it is given (preferably within 24 hours), the more likely that it will work. Patients who were exposed to an HIV-, HBV-, or HCV-positive source patient require retesting for the positive virus. Patients exposed to an HIV-positive source require retesting at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months postexposure, although some evidence has shown that patients may only need to be tested for up to 4 months when fourth-generation HIV tests are used. Patients who have been exposed to an HBV-positive source and are not immune should be vaccinated at the time of exposure and undergo HBV testing at 1-2 months postexposure. Patients who have been exposed to an HCV-positive source need to undergo anti-HCV antibody retesting at 4-6 months postexposure. If the patient originally tested negative for HBV, was not immune for HBV, and never received HBV vaccination, the patient will need follow-up to receive the full HBV vaccination series. Hospital employees who have been exposed to body fluids should be reported to and referred to the hospital’s occupational health service. This is important not only for the health care provider who was exposed but also for the other hospital employees who may be exposed in the future, as this reporting may prompt the institution’s administration to take steps to prevent future incidents. Differential Diagnoses Diagnostic Considerations In addition to the health care worker involved becoming ill because of the exposure, the worker may become a potential health risk to patients in the future, and this may need to be addressed. Also, if the worker becomes too ill to work, this will adversely affect his or her economic well-being, and the worker may need worker’s compensation and/or disability. Rapid Testing for HIV Sexual Assault Viral Hepatitis Workers compensation Medication Medication Summary Tetanus toxoid should be administered intramuscularly. Health care workers who sustain a significant exposure to HBV and have not been immunized or are nonresponders should receive passive immunization with HBIG. Guidelines on the management of occupational exposures to HIV and PEP are available from the US Public Health Service. [ 7]  HIV prophylaxis HIV prophylaxis for standard exposure (the presence of an identified risk factor for occupational exposure) is raltegravir 400 mg PO twice daily  plus  tenofovir DF 300 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg (Truvada) 1 tablet PO once daily. Risk factors include the following: Deep injury Presence of visible blood on the instrument causing the exposure Injury with a device that was placed in a vein or artery of the source patient Terminal illness in the source patient Currently, prophylaxis for high-risk exposure is the same for any exposure that is deemed risky enough to warrant HIV prophylaxis. Prophylaxis for any significant exposure now involves at least 3 drugs. The two-drug regimens are generally no longer used. If there is any confusion about whether HIV prophylaxis should be administered or which regimen should be used, an expert in this field should be consulted. The preferred regimen for HIV prophylaxis as noted above is raltegravir plus Truvada. The initial dose should be given as a stat dose in the ED, and the therapy should be continued for 28 days. Pediatric dosing is as follows: Raltegravir: If the patient weighs less than 25 kg, 6 mg/kg twice daily to a maximum of 600 mg/day; if the patient weighs more than 25 kg, the adult dose of 400 mg BID film coated tablet should be used Emtricitabine: If the patient is aged 0-3 months, 3 mg/kg; if the patient is older than 3 months, 6 mg/kg to a maximum of 200 mg capsule per day or 6 mg/kg solution PO QD; not to exceed 240 mg/day Tenofovir DF: If the patient is aged 2-12 years, 8 mg/kg once a day to a maximum of 300 mg/day Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) Class Summary These agents inhibit reverse transcriptase and cause chain termination when incorporated into a growing viral strand. Zidovudine (Retrovir) Zidovudine is a thymidine analogue that inhibits viral replication. Retrovir in combination with lamivudine is known as Combivir; in combination with abacavir and lamivudine, it is known as Trizivir. Combivir and Trizivir should not be used in patients with renal insufficiency.  Lamivudine (Epivir, Epivir-HBV) Lamivudine is a cytosine analogue that inhibits viral replication. In addition to anti-HIV activity, this agent also suppresses hepatitis B viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication.  Emtricitabine (Emtriva) Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside cytosine analogue. It competes with deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate and is incorporated into viral DNA, causing chain termination.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) Tenofovir is an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. It is administered as the prodrug bis-isopropoxycarbonyloxymethyl ester derivative of tenofovir, which is converted, through various enzymatic processes, to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5'-monophosphate. Bioavailability is enhanced by a high-fat meal. Prolonged intracellular distribution allows for once-daily dosing. Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Class Summary These agents inhibit HIV-1 viral replication. Efavirenz (Sustiva) Efavirenz is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that derives its activity against HIV-1 by binding to reverse transcriptase. Efavirenz blocks ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, including HIV-1 replication. It does not require intracellular phosphorylation for antiviral activity.  HIV, Protease Inhibitors Class Summary These agents block the modification of precursor polyproteins that are responsible for the synthesis of reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 protease.  Indinavir (Crixivan) Indinavir prevents formation of protein precursors necessary for HIV infection of uninfected cells and viral replication. Nelfinavir (Viracept) Nelfinavir inhibits HIV-1 protease, resulting in the production of an immature and noninfectious virus. Darunavir (Prezista) Darunavir selectively inhibits HIV-encoded Gag-Pol polyprotein cleavage in infected cells, thereby preventing mature virus particle formation. Indicated for HIV disease that has not responded to treatment with other antiretroviral agents. Coadminister with low-dose ritonavir (ritonavir-boosted therapy decreases elimination and increases darunavir serum concentration). Typically coadministered with other anti-HIV agents (eg, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Food increases bioavailability. Indicated for HIV infection in antiretroviral treatment–experienced adults (eg, those with HIV-1 strains resistant to more than one protease inhibitor). Ritonavir (Norvir) Ritonavir is used in a drug combination of a double or triple therapy with nucleosides and other protease inhibitors. Immune Globulins Class Summary Patients who may not have been immunized against  Clostridium tetani  products should receive tetanus immunoglobulin (HyperTet). Tetanus immunoglobulin (HyperTET S/D) This agent is used for the passive immunization of any person with a wound that might be contaminated with tetanus spores. Vaccines, Inactivated, Bacterial Class Summary These agents are used for tetanus immunization. A booster injection against tetanus in previously immunized individuals is recommended to prevent this potentially lethal syndrome.  Tetanus toxoid adsorbed or fluid This induces active immunity against tetanus in selected patients. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis toxoids (TDAP) are the immunizing agents of choice for most adults and children (>7 y). Booster doses are necessary to maintain tetanus immunity throughout life. Pregnant patients should receive only tetanus toxoid, not a diphtheria antigen–containing product. The immunizing agent may be administered into the deltoid or midlateral thigh muscles of children and adults. In infants, the preferred site of administration is the midthigh laterally. Antiretroviral agents, integrase inhibitor Class Summary These agents inhibit the incorporation of viral DNA into the genome of the host's cell, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 viral replication. Raltegravir (Isentress) Raltegravir is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase strand transfer inhibitor (HIV-1 INSTI). Prevents the integration of the proviral gene into human DNA by inhibiting the catalytic activity of integrase.  HIV, ART Combos Class Summary These agents inhibit HIV-1 viral replication by inhibiting nucleoside reverse transcriptase through different mechanisms. Emtricitabine and tenofovir (Truvada) Emtricitabine: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI); following phosphorylation, interferes with HIV viral DNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication; cytosine analogue Tenofovir: Emtricitabine: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI); following phosphorylation, interferes with HIV viral DNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication; cytosine analogue Lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir) Lamivudine: NRTI; following phosphorylation, inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by viral DNA chain termination; cytosine analog Zidovudine: NRTI; interferes with HIV viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (inhibits viral replication); thymidine analog Flowsheet for management of blood/body fluid exposures.

				"body": "Overview Approximately 3-5% of live births are complicated by a birth defect each year totaling around 120,000 babies. [ 1]   Drug use is an uncommon cause of birth defects, but certain medications can increase the likelihood of developing a birth defect. Additionally, more women taking any kind of medication has more than doubled in the last 30 years. [ 2]   Current evidence suggests that between 65%-94 % of women take at least one prescription drug during pregnancy. [ 3,  4]   Nearly 70% of women are taking a medication in the first trimester during organogenesis. [ 3]   On average, women are taking 3 medications in pregnancy [ 4]  with over 50% of women using four or more. [ 3]   This includes over the counter medications and herbal supplements. The purpose of this article is to provide an up to date source of information about medication use in pregnancy, to review the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy and lactation categories, and to further describe the recent FDA changes in drug labeling from December 2014.     Approach to Patients Needing Medication During Pregnancy Because any medication can present risks in pregnancy, and because not all risks are known, the safest pregnancy-related pharmacy is as little pharmacy as possible. However, women with underlying medical or psychiatric issues frequently require medication throughout pregnancy. In such patients, care must to be taken to select the safest drug from the necessary class of medication. Misri and Kendrick noted that prescribing drugs for women during the antenatal and postnatal period is a balancing act and that no risk-free alternatives exist. [ 5]  Each area of pharmacologic therapy intervention must be assessed separately and specifically for each patient. For example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common during pregnancy and presents difficulties in choosing optimal medications. [ 6]  For most patients, lifestyle modifications are useful, but if these interventions are insufficient to control symptoms, and medication is often required. First-line medical therapy for pregnant woman with GERD entails antacids. If antacids fail, use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors can be attempted; these drugs do not seem to be associated with clinically significant risks in pregnancy. In rare cases, promotility agents can be prescribed, though the risks and benefits must carefully be discussed with the patients before the drugs are started. A physician caring for a pregnant patient who requires medication should take care in choosing dosages and types of drugs that maximize effectiveness while minimizing fetal risk. It is essential to understand the effect of medications and to know the point in fetal development when drugs are most toxic and which fetal organs are most susceptible. In addition, healthcare providers who treat pregnant women must be familiar with methods of gathering information about drugs, and they must be aware of online databases that are most useful for this purpose. Several resources are available to expand one’s knowledge of teratology. Teratogen Information System (TERIS) and Reprotox are Internet databases that cover this subject. The Organization of Teratology Information Specialists is a network of risk-assessment counselors in the United States and Canada who specialize in researching and communicating the risks associated with drug exposures in pregnancy. All of these are useful resources to learn about drug use in pregnancy. They are frequently updated and should be referenced frequently, particularly when one is prescribing unfamiliar drugs in pregnancy.  Primary literature searches via MEDLINE can also provide information about human data, clinical trials, and meta-analyses regarding a particular drug. [ 3]   Finally, the drug label can provide information about toxicity.  Since 1979 the FDA has provided a labeling system in an attempt to guide providers in prescribing drugs to pregnant women. This system will be discussed later in the article. General guidelines for choosing dosages and types of drugs within a class are lacking. Each drug should be assessed, and its risks and benefits should be weighed. Various organizations, including the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists, have performed many studies in this area. Specific drugs should be investigated before they are used. Risk-benefit assessment and counseling should involve the patient in the setting of her current state of health. The physician must consider the effects of drug exposure on the developing fetus or embryo and acknowledge specific susceptibilities at each point in fetal development, as balanced against the risks of worsening maternal illness.  The patient must consider her symptoms, quality of life, and weigh risks and benefits of treatment.  The most important consideration is the underlying disease and the consideration of the consequences of interrupting or stopping treatment. [ 3]  In a 2008 Canadian study, 19.4% of women were found to have used FDA category C, D and X medications at least once during pregnancy, the most common of these being albuterol, co-trimoxazole, ibuprofen, naproxen and oral contraceptives. [ 7]  Analyzing the same data, Yang noted that woman who had such exposure were more commonly characterized by chronic diseases, younger age, increased parity, and receipt of social assistance. [ 8]  Combinations of medications rather than individual medicines are possibly associated with increased risk of birth defects.  Oberlander et al performed a study to determine a population-based incidence of congenital anomalies following prenatal exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants used alone and in combination with benzodiazepines. In this study, population health data, maternal health, and prenatal prescription records were linked to neonatal records, representing all live births in British Columbia during a 39-month period (1998-2001). Even after controlling for maternal illness profiles, infants exposed to prenatal serotonin reuptake inhibitors in combination with benzodiazepines had an increased incidence of congenital heart disease versus controls who had not been exposed. Serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy was not associated with an increased risk for major congenital anomalies, but was associated with an increased incidence of atrial septal defects, and researchers did not associate risk with first trimester medication dose/day. [ 9]  Grigoriadis et al concluded that antidepressants do not seem to be associated with increased risk of congenital malformations, but evidence showed a statistical significance for cardiovascular malformations. [ 10]  A population-based cohort study of 179,007 children by Viktorin et al examined the association of maternal antidepressant medication use during pregnancy with intellectual disability in their children. The study found that intellectual disability was diagnosed in 37 children (0.9%) exposed to antidepressants and in 819 children (0.5%) unexposed to antidepressants. The relative risk of intellectual disability after antidepressant exposure was estimated at 1.33 (95% CI, 0.90-1.98) in the full population sample and 1.64 (95% CI, 0.95-2.83) in the subsample of women with depression. Although the relative risk was increased in children born to mothers treated with antidepressants, the study found no evidence of an association after adjusting for confounding factors.

Example Mechanisms of Teratogenesis In 1977 James Wilson proposed six principles of teratology that were subsequently published in the  Handbook of Teratology.   The six principles he identified are: 1.    Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends upon the genotype of the conceptus and how it interacts with environmental Factors.  2.    Susceptibility to teratogenic agents varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure 3.    Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissue to initiate abnormal embryogenesis. 4.    The final manifestations of abnormal development are death, malformation, growth retardation, and functional disorder. 5.    The access of adverse environmental influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the agent. 6.    Manifestations of deviant development increase in degree as dosage increases from the no-effect to the totally lethal effect. [ 13]  Drug Exposures in the Male Partner Research is increasingly addressing the role of paternal exposure to medications before conception or during his partner’s pregnancy. Certain exposures may alter the size, shape, performance, and production of sperm. This observation suggests that drug exposure in the male may put the fetus at risk. Animal studies have shown that paternal teratogenic exposure may lead to pregnancy loss or failure of the embryo to develop. However, unlike teratogenic agents taken by pregnant woman, teratogenic agents affecting the father do not seem to directly interfere with normal fetal development. Animal studies show that paternal teratogenic exposure may lead to pregnancy loss or embryonic failure. [ 14,  15]  At present, no evidence shows that paternal exposure directly increases the risk of birth defects.  A large cohort of over 340,000 pregnancies in Norway did not find paternal drug exposure to be a particularly important cause of birth defects or adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially after controlling for confounding factors with maternal exposure. [ 16]   Agents such as recreational drugs do affect sperm quality and, to a limited degree, indirectly expose the developing fetus to the substance. Rather than affecting the developing fetus, teratogen exposures like illicit drugs and alcohol seem to lower the likelihood of a woman's becoming pregnant rather than resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. [ 14,  15]  Paternal alcohol use may increase the risk of heart defects in newborns. In one study, paternal smoking was associated with heart defects. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy to treat cancer in a father may increase the risk chromosomal abnormalities of the fetus. Studies have demonstrated less-than-normal numbers of chromosomes and damage to the structure of chromosomes in the sperm of men with cancer. No data suggests an increased rate of birth defects in fetuses conceived with sperm from male chemotherapy patients. [ 17,  18]  Paternal exposure to prescription medications, such as cholesterol- and blood pressure–lowering drugs, has not been linked to a risk of birth defects. Additional research must clearly be conducted to assess the safety of drugs recently released onto the market. Regardless of the lack of evidence supporting a direct influence of paternal exposure on fetal risk, caution is warranted, and the father's physician should provide counseling and active involve the patient. FDA Rating System for the Teratogenic Effects of Drugs The first regulations to drug labeling were implemented in 1962 after the exposure of over 10,000 children to thalidomide. [ 2,  19]  The 5-letter classification system (A, B, C, D, X) was then introduced in 1979 by the FDA.  These categories were developed based on the  amount and quality  of research done on the medication, not the  safety  of the medication in pregnancy or lactation.  It has been demonstrated that these categories, while relied upon to guide treatment of pregnant and lactating women, have been misinterpreted and are being misused. [ 2,  4]   Additionally, approximately 66% of all drugs are listed as category C indicating there is limited information about the safety of these medications. [ 4]  Thus, the 5-letter system is being phased out over the next 3 years in favor of a more comprehensive system with a narrative summary of the risks posed by drugs. The FDA, the government agency that oversees the safety of drugs, provides the most widely used system to grade the teratogenic effects of medications. Each drug summary will have three sections: pregnancy, lactation, and females and males of reproductive potential.  “Pregnancy” merges previous categories of “pregnancy” and “labor and delivery.”  “Lactation” replaces “breastfeeding mothers” and all medications will be required to have this section. [ 2]  “Females and males of reproductive potential” is a new category to include information about pregnancy testing, contraception requirements, and effects on fertility before, during, and after drug therapy. An additional requirement with the new FDA classification system, is the inclusion of information about pregnancy exposure registries under the “pregnancy” category.  Contact information needed to enroll in the registry or obtain information about the registry will be included as well. In June 2015, the FDA shifted from the A, B, C, D, X categorization system to a new system for all drugs which enter the market after this time, and requires removal of the old categorization from all drug product labeling for drugs on the market over the next three to four years.  The pregnancy subsection is now presented under the following subheadings: Pregnancy Exposure Registry Risk Summary Clinical Considerations Data \t\t Pregnancy Exposure Registry \t\t\t\t If there is a scientifically acceptable pregnancy exposure registry for the drug, the contact information (toll free number or website) needed to enroll in or obtain information about the registry must be provided.  The availability of a pregnancy exposure registry should be noted in the patient counseling information.  Risk Summary \t\t\t\t This is always required. Provides “risk statements” that describe for the drug, the risk of adverse developmental outcomes bases on all relevant human data, animal data, and the drugs pharmacology.  Adverse developmental outcomes include the four groups of developmental toxicities: - \"Structural abnormalities\" describes dysmorphology, which includes malformations, variations, deformations, and disruptions. - \"Embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality\" describes development mortality, which includes miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death (including neonatal death). - \"Functional impairment\" describes functional toxicity, which includes such outcomes as deafness, endocrinopathy, neurodevelopmental effects, and impairment of reproduction. - \"Alterations to growth\" describes outcomes such as growth restriction, excessive growth, and delayed or early maturations. When multiple data sources are available, risk statements must be presented in the following order: human, animal, and pharmacologic.  The risk summary should be presented as an integral summary and not as an individual listing of information.  If there is more than one risk based on human data, the information should be placed in order of clinical importance. Clinical Considerations  See the list below: Relevant information is presented under the following five headings, to the extent information is available: - Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk - Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period - Maternal adverse reactions - Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions - Labor or Delivery Data \t\t\t\t --Under the subheading Data, labeling must describe the data that provide the scientific basis for the information presented in the Risk Summary and Clinical Considerations. This subheading is required, as are the headings Human Data and Animal Data, to the extent information is available. Human data and animal data must be presented separately, and human data must be presented first. ]]>--Under the subheading Data, labeling must describe the data that provide the scientific basis for the information presented in the Risk Summary and Clinical Considerations. This subheading is required, as are the headings Human Data and Animal Data, to the extent information is available. Human data and animal data must be presented separately, and human data must be presented first. ]]> Drugs That Reportedly Cause Birth Defects Data for specific agents in the sections that follow were assembled to assist the provider in weighing the risks and benefits before beginning or continuing their use pregnancy. Information was compiled by selecting commonly used drugs, with an emphasis on recently approved agents. Discussion of Specific Agents: Antibiotics, Antiviral, Antiretroviral Aminoglycosides  (Amikacin, Gentamycin, Kanamycin, Tobramycin, Neomycin, and Streptomycin) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk summary: Trimester of risk - not consistent. Associated defects and complications: Some neonates have had hearing defects, whereas others have had vestibular problems. Some offspring had inner ear damage, whereas others did not. Data: Since 1950, approximately 50 cases of fetal ototoxicity have been described after maternal exposure to either streptomycin or its congener dihydrostreptomycin. Ten cases of fetal ototoxicity have been described with kanamycin, a related drug. These cases occurred when high doses were used to treat tuberculosis. Gentamicin may be ototoxic to adults and to developing fetuses. Evidence indicates that fetal kidney selectively takes up gentamicin, which can result in cellular damage (probably reversible) to immature nephrons. In addition, inner ear damage or hearing defects have been induced in utero in rats and guinea pigs exposed to streptomycin and/or kanamycin. Antiretrovirals  (Abacavir, Didanosine, Emtricitabine, Lamivudine, Stavudine, Tenofovir, Zalcitabine, Zidovudine, Delavirdine, Efavirenz, Etravirine, Nevirapine, Rilpivirine, Atazanavir, Darunavir, Fosamprenavir, Indinavir, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Tipranavir, Raltegravir, Dolutegravir, Elvitegravir, Maraviroc, Enfuvirtide) Old categorization: Pregnancy category B and C Risk summary: Didanosine had increased risk of birth defects in first trimester as well as later in pregnancy. No specific pattern of defects was noted and clinical relevance is uncertain. Potential fetal safety concern: cynomolgus monkeys receiving efavirenz (EFV) during the first trimester at a dose resulting in plasma levels comparable to systemic human therapeutic exposure had 3 of 20 infants with significant CNS or other malformations. In humans, there is no increase in overall birth defects with first-trimester EFV exposure. However, in humans with first- trimester exposure, there have been 6 retrospective case reports and 1 prospective case report of CNS defects and 1 prospective case report of anophthalmia with facial clefts. The relative risk with first-trimester exposure is unclear.  The remainder of the antiretrovirals appear to have minimal risk to the fetus with no higher incidence of birth defects. Data: Studies in monkeys for tenofovir (at doses approximately 2-fold higher than that for human therapeutic use) show decreased fetal growth and reduction in fetal bone porosity within 2 months of starting maternal therapy. Human studies demonstrate no effect on intrauterine growth, but data are conflicting about potential outcomes later in infancy. Cidofovir  (Vistide) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown. Associated defects and complications - Possible external, soft tissue, and skeletal anomalies (ie, meningocele, short snout, short maxillary bones) of the fetus Clinical considerations: Cidofovir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.  Potential risk for carcinogenicity in the mother at higher doses. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies of cidofovir (Vistide; Gilead Sciences, Inc, Foster City, CA) have been performed in pregnant women. This drug was embryotoxic (reduced fetal body weights) in rats at 1.5 mg/kg/d and in rabbits at 1 mg/kg/d, dosages which were also maternally toxic with daily intravenous dosing during the period of organogenesis. The no-observable-effect levels for embryotoxicity in rats (0.5 mg/kg/d) and in rabbits (0.25 mg/kg/d) were respectively about 0.04 and 0.05 times the clinical dosage (5 mg/kg every other wk) based on the AUC. An increased prevalence of fetal external, soft tissue, and skeletal anomalies (ie, meningocele, short snout, short maxillary bones) occurred in rabbits at the high dosage of 1 mg/kg/d, which was also maternally toxic. Fluconazole  (Diflucan) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C (single dose); D (multiple doses) Risk summary: Trimester of risk – First. Associated defects and complications - Craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiac effects Data:  Available human data do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies following a single maternal dose of 150 mg (Diflucan, Pfizer) for vaginal candidiasis. A few published case reports describe a rare pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants expose d in utero to high-dose maternal fluconazole (400-800 mg/d) during most or all of the first trimester; reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies and consist of brachycephaly, abnormal facies, abnormal calvarial development, cleft palate, femoral bowing, thin ribs and long bones, arthrogryposis, and congenital heart disease.  Animal Studies: In several studies in which pregnant rats received fluconazole orally during organogenesis, maternal weight gain was impaired and placental weights were increased at 25 mg/kg. There were no fetal effects at 5 or 10 mg/kg; increases in fetal anatomical variants (supernumerary ribs, renal pelvis dilation) and delays in ossification were observed at 25 and 50 mg/kg and higher doses. At doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg/kg (approximately 2 to 8 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA), embryo lethality in rats was increased and fetal abnormalities included wavy ribs, cleft palate, and abnormal craniofacial ossification. These effects are consistent with the inhibition of estrogen synthesis in rats and may be a result of known effects of lowered estrogen on pregnancy, organogenesis, and parturition Tetracyclines  (Doxycycline, Tetracycline, Minocycline, Demeclocycline, Tigecycline) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - Second and third (20th gestational week or later).  Associated defects and complications - Dental staining Clinical Consideration: Use during the last half of pregnancy may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth to a yellow- gray/brown color.  This class of drug should not be used during pregnancy. Data: As little as 1 g/d of tetracycline for 3 days during the third trimester can produce yellow staining of deciduous teeth. After their eruption, yellow-stained teeth gradually darken to brown. Calcification of deciduous teeth begins at the end of the fourth month of gestation and ends at approximately 11-14 months of age. Administration of tetracycline to pregnant women in the second and third trimesters results in staining of dentine, with calcification of the enamel at the time of administration. Because the permanent teeth begin calcifying after birth, they are not affected by prenatal exposure. Although several case reports have described malformations (including enamel hypoplasia) after tetracycline use in pregnancy, findings from relatively large studies have mostly been negative. Despite this finding, tetracycline has been referred to as a teratogen in numerous publications. Tinidazole  (Tindamax) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Variable Clinical Consideration: Tinidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters fetal circulation, it should not be administered to pregnant patients in the first trimester.  Tinidazole can be detected in breast milk for up to 72 hours following administration. Interruption of breast-feeding is recommended during tinidazole therapy and for 3 days following the last dose. Data: Use of tinidazole (Tindamax; Mission Pharmacal Company, San Antonio, TX) has not been studied in pregnant patients. Studies of pregnant mice indicated no embryonic-fetal toxicity or malformations at the highest dose level of 2500 mg/kg (approximately 6.3-fold the highest human therapeutic dose based on body surface area conversions).In a study of pregnant rats, a slightly elevated frequency of fetal mortality was observed at a maternal dose of 500 mg/kg (2.5 times the highest human therapeutic dose based on body surface area conversions).No biologically relevant neonatal developmental effects were observed in rat neonates after maternal doses as high as 600 mg/kg (3 times the highest human therapeutic dose based on body surface area conversions).            Discussion of Specific Agents: Cardiovascular Medications Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  (Benzapril, captopril, enalopril, fosinopril, lisinpril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C or D Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First trimester (category C); second and third trimesters (category D).  Associated defects and complications: Reported complications in pregnancy included oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), premature labor, and fetal and neonatal renal failure. Reported birth defects included bony malformations, limb contractures, persistent patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypoplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged hypotension, neonatal death, fetal calvarial hypoplasia or aplasia, oligohydramnios, and renal anomalies. Clinical Consideration: Recommendation to stop an ACE inhibitor as soon as possible if a patient is discovered to be pregnant. Data: One study demonstrated successful pregnancy outcomes (ie, live, healthy infant without severe disability at 2 y after delivery) in 87.5% of patients taking ACE inhibitors at any time during pregnancy. Boix et al reported a case of exencephaly and unilateral renal agenesia in a fetus of a woman with diabetes who became pregnant while taking irbesartan. [ 20]   In a retrospective cohort study, Li et al found that during the first trimester the risk of malformations with the use of ACE inhibitors is similar to the use of other antihypertensives; the authors hypothesized that the apparent increased risk of malformations is due more to the mother’s underlying hypertension rather than the medications. [ 21]  Amlodipine/atorvastatin  (Caduet) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - X Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Variable; spina bifida Clinical considerations: Amlodipine/atorvastatin (Caduet; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) should be administered to women of childbearing only if they are highly unlikely to become pregnant and if they have been informed of the potential hazards associated with ingestion during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued, and the patient should be informed of the potential hazards to the fetus. Data: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a three-to-four-fold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89% of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mg/m2).  Cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). Because 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, they may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]   (cadesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Hypotension, renal dysplasia, anuria or oliguria, oligohydramnios, IUGR, pulmonary hypoplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, incomplete ossification of the skull, and intrauterine or neonatal death Clinical considerations: Because of the severity of these complications, use of ARBs should be avoided throughout pregnancy and in women who are breastfeeding. Data: Data from recent animal studies confirmed that intrauterine or neonatal exposure to ACE inhibitors or the ARB losartan can cause death and serious irreversible organ damage. Data from animal studies suggested that the toxic actions were most common after exposure during the last trimester. Aspirin Old classification: Pregnancy category  D Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk – First, second, and third. Low dose may be acceptable as lower risk.  Associated defects and complications - Unclear; may be associated with an increased risk of gastroschisis.  Risks seem to be associated with dosing. High-dose aspirin (2 g per day) has been associated with stillbirths, cerebral hemorrhage, oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia, neonatal salicylate toxicity, constricted ductus arteriosus, cyclopia, and neonatal acidosis. Some cases of congenital heart defects have been reported. Data: In a meta-analysis, no evidence of an overall increase in the risk of congenital malformations was reported associated with aspirin. Aspirin exposure during the first trimester may be associated with an increased risk of gastroschisis. A study of the use of low-dose aspirin (60 mg per day) to prevent and treat preeclampsia in 9364 pregnant women (the Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy--CLASP) did \"not support routine prophylactic or therapeutic administration of antiplatelet therapy in pregnancy to all women at increased risk of preeclampsia or IUGR.\" In that study, no excess of intraventricular hemorrhage, neonatal bleeds, or mortality attributable to bleeding were observed. The investigators did identify a possible role for low-dose aspirin in the treatment of early-onset preeclampsia severe enough to need very preterm delivery. Another study of low-dose aspirin (follow-up from the Italian Study of Aspirin in Pregnancy) has suggested that \"low dose aspirin in pregnancy is safe with respect to the risks of malformation and of major impairment in development at 18 months of age.\" High-dose aspirin (2 g per day) has been associated with stillbirths, cerebral hemorrhage, oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia, neonatal salicylate toxicity, constricted ductus arteriosus, cyclopia, and neonatal acidosis. Some cases of congenital heart defects have been reported. However, a case control study of aspirin use in the first trimester concluded that aspirin \"does not increase the risk of congenital heart defects in relation to that of other structural malformations.\" Atenolol  (Tenormin) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - IUGR Data: There are no studies for use in the first trimester. Animal and human studies have shown growth retardation in humans and animals, as well as growth and structural abnormalities in animals. Reduced fetal size is a function of the length of exposure to the medication. The earlier the treatment starts, the greater the incidence of defects.  Beta blocker use has been associated with decreased placental perfusion, and may lead to intra-uterine deaths, immature and premature deliveries. Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors)  (Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Pravastatin, Lovastatin, Fluvastatin, Pitavastatin, Cerivastatin, Mevastatin) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - X Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Possible spina bifida Clinical Consideration: Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal growth.  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. Data: The causal nature of these defects remains to be fully defined. These drugs did no cause birth defects in rabbit testing. Discussion of Specific Agents: Neurologic Medications Anticonvulsants, first-generation  (Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, ethosuximide, primidone) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - D in general Risk summery: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Facial dysmorphia, gingival hyperplasia, neurological hyperexcitability and multiple malformations including (for valproic acid) predominantly temporal atrophy in the left brain hemisphere Data: In a retrospective cohort study published in the  New England Journal of Medicine , investigators examined newborns who were exposed to anticonvulsants in utero, born to mothers with epilepsy who did not take anticonvulsants, or born to mothers without epilepsy or a history of seizures. Birth defects occurred most frequently in infants exposed to anticonvulsants. About 20% of neonates exposed to 1 drug had birth defects; 28% exposed to 2 or more drugs had birth defects. Major birth defects were found in 4% of 223 babies whose mothers had taken 1 drug during pregnancy and in 8.6% of 93 whose mothers had taken 2 or more drugs. 23  Others researchers state that the risk doubles when 2 drugs are taken and that the risk is 10-fold higher than the risk in the control population when women take 4 anticonvulsants. Babies of mothers with epilepsy who were not treated with anticonvulsants were at no greater risk for having birth defects than were babies of mothers without epilepsy. Carbamazepine  (Tegretol, Carbatrol) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Unique facial appearance, microcephaly, and limb defects, including complete or partial absence of a limb, overgrowth, or underdevelopment of the fingers, toes, and nails, fused limbs; spina bifida, growth retardation, developmental delay 24 Clinical considerations: Women should be warned of these dangerous and potentially fatal side effects before becoming pregnant. Data: One study revealed a 2-fold increase in the rate of major congenital anomalies (12 of 160 carbamazepine subjects vs 18 of 560 unexposed control subjects, relative risk of 2.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-4.56%). Another finding was a birthweight reduction of approximately 250 g. Other reports indicated an increased risk for spina bifida of up to 1 (1%) per 100 compared with the population risk of 1-2 cases per 1000 births.  According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1989, fetal exposure to carbamazepine could interrupt fetal development and congenital malformation. The study observed 35 children who were prenatally exposed to the drug and found that 11 percent were born with craniofacial defects, 26 percent developed hypoplasia and 20 percent experienced developmental delay. Ergotamine  (Ergomar, Ergostat, Mirgranal) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - X Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Low birth weight and preterm birth Clinical considerations: Dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties and, therefore, should not be administered during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Data: Studies have shown a possible association between low birthweight and/or preterm birth. Ergotamine treatment may be connected with ergotamine-induced vasoconstriction in the placenta of pregnant women. The effect of ergotamine was most obvious in male newborn infants, particularly after treatment in the third trimester.  There are no adequate studies of dihydroergotamine in human pregnancy, but developmental toxicity has been demonstrated in experimental animals. In embryo-fetal development studies of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, intranasal administration to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and/or skeletal ossification at doses of 0.16 mg/day (associated with maternal plasma dihydroergotamine exposures [AUC] approximately 0.4-1.2 times the exposures in humans receiving the MRDD of 4 mg) or greater. A no effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity was not established in rats. Delayed skeletal ossification was also noted in rabbit fetuses following intranasal administration of 3.6 mg/day (maternal exposures approximately 7 times human exposures at the MRDD) during organogenesis. A no effect level was seen at 1.2 mg/day (maternal exposures approximately 2.5 times human exposures at the MRDD). When dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray was administered intranasally to female rats during pregnancy and lactation, decreased body weights and impaired reproductive function (decreased mating indices) were observed in the offspring at doses of 0.16 mg/day or greater. A no effect level was not established. Effects on development occurred at doses below those that produced evidence of significant maternal toxicity in these studies. Dihydroergotamine-induced intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to reduced uteroplacental blood flow resulting from prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and/or increased myometrial tone. Natalizumab  (Tysabri) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – C Pregnancy risk exposure: 1-800-456-2255 Natalizumab Pregnancy Exposure Registry Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown. Associated defects and complications - Unknown Clinical Considerations: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Natalizumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data: In reproductive studies of monkeys and guinea pigs, no evidence of teratogenic effects was observed at dosages up to 30 mg/kg (7 times the human clinical dose based on body-weight comparison). In a study in which female guinea pigs were exposed to natalizumab during the second half of pregnancy, a small reduction in pup survival was noted at postnatal day 14 compared with controls (3 pups per litter for the group treated with 30 mg/kg natalizumab and 4.3 pups per litter for the control group).In 1 of 5 studies in which monkeys or guinea pigs were exposed during pregnancy, the abortion rate in monkeys treated with 30 mg/kg was 33% versus 17% in controls. No effects on abortion rates were noted in any other study. Natalizumab underwent transplacental transfer and yielded in utero exposure in developing guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys. When pregnant dams were exposed to natalizumab at approximately 7 times the clinical dose, serum levels in fetal animals at delivery were approximately 35% of maternal serum levels. A study of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys treated at 2.3-fold the clinical dose demonstrated natalizumab-related changes in the fetuses. The changes included mild anemia, reduced platelet counts, increased splenic weights, and reduced hepatic and thymic weights in association with increased splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, thymic atrophy, and decreased hepatic hematopoiesis. Platelet counts were also reduced in offspring born to mothers treated with natalizumab at 7 times the clinical dose. This effect was reversed upon clearance of natalizumab. The offspring had no evidence of anemia. Because results of animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it is clearly needed. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking natalizumab, discontinuation should be considered. Whether natalizumab is excreted in human milk is unknown. Because many drugs and immunoglobulins are excreted in human milk and because the potential for serious adverse reactions is unknown, a decision should be made about whether nursing or natalizumab should be discontinued; this should depend on the importance of therapy to the mother. Phenobarbital or methylphenobarbital Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk Summary: Trimester of risk - Late in pregnancy. Associated defects and complications - Phenobarbital or methylphenobarbital slightly increases the risk of cleft palate or lip and congenital heart disease. These drugs can cause fetal addiction and newborn withdrawal symptoms or newborn hemorrhage Clinical Consideration: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Data: Long-term use of phenobarbital late in pregnancy has been associated with transient neonatal sedation or withdrawal symptoms in infants. Features observed in these infants include hyperactivity, irritability, and tremors. Perinatal or neonatal hemorrhage has occasionally been observed in infants of women who took phenobarbital late in pregnancy. This phenomenon has been attributed to drug-induced suppression of synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. Phenytoin  (Dilantin) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – D Pregnancy risk exposure: 1-888-233-2334 or  http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure, physicians are recommended to reenroll patients in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown. Associated defects and complications - Varied Hand and foot defects include fingerlike thumbs, aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanges, supernumerary phalangeal epiphyses, and clubfoot. Dermatoglyphic abnormalities consist of abnormal palmar creases and nail hypoplasia or aplasia. General defects include growth retardation, atypical facial appearance, hirsutism, and low hairlines. Facial problems include microcephaly, brachycephaly, midfacial hypoplasia, wide fontanels, metopic ridging, mild micrognathia, low-set deformed ears, blepharoptosis, mild hypertelorism, strabismus, short nose with a broad depressed bridge and epicanthal folds, cupid's bow of the upper lip, and occasionally cleft lip and palate. Reported torso abnormalities include short neck with mild webbing, widely spaced nipples, umbilical or inguinal hernia, and rib anomalies. Internal abnormalities include variable coarctation of the aorta, endocardial cushion defect, double-outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, bicuspid pulmonic valve, and intestinal malrotation. Ambiguous genitalia are rarely associated with this syndrome. A patient with the dysmorphic characteristics of fetal hydantoin syndrome presented with unusual hyperpigmentation of several fingernails. Another neonate presented with gum hypertrophy, digitalization of the thumbs, hypoplasia of the distal phalanges and nails, epicanthal folds, pseudohypertelorism, epidermoid cyst, and geographic tongue. Onychopathy can be a monosymptomatic or mild form of this syndrome. This syndrome may be associated with neonatal acne. Clinical Consideration: An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered pharmacokinetics.  Periodic measurement of plasma phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women. Infant breastfeeding is not recommended. Data: Phenytoin affects folate and vitamin K metabolism, which may increase fetal bleeding. Some investigators have suggested that vitamin K be administered to mothers taking phenytoin in the third trimester to prevent hemorrhage. However, the available evidence does not justify this policy of giving vitamin K throughout the last third of pregnancy to all women being treated with anticonvulsants. When used in pregnancy, phenytoin can cause a syndrome of birth defects referred to with various names, such as Dilantin congenital defects, fetal hydantoin syndrome (FHS), Meadow syndrome, congenital hydantoin syndrome, Dilantin syndrome, fetal Dilantin syndrome, fetal phenytoin syndrome, and hydantoin syndrome. Various malformations have been reported to occur because of phenytoin intake during pregnancy. Pregabalin  (Lyrica) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – C Pregnancy risk exposure: Pregnant patients exposed to pregabalin should be enrolled in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry (1-888-233-2334 or  http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/  ). Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk – Unknown, possible first.  Associated defects and complications – Growth restriction and  Clinical Consideration: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Data: When pregnant rats were given pregabalin orally throughout the period of organogenesis, incidences of specific skull alterations attributed to abnormally advanced ossification. Fetal body weights were decreased at the highest dose. When pregnant rabbits were given pregabalin orally throughout the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal body weight and increased incidences of skeletal malformations, visceral variations, and retarded ossification were observed at the highest dose. Trimethadione  (Tridione) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – D Pregnancy risk exposure: Patients exposed during pregnancy need to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry (1-888-233-2334). Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Malformed ears, cleft palate, cardiac defects, urogenital malformations, and skeletal abnormalities; delayed mental and physical development also observe Clinical Consideration: Trimethadione should only be prescribed to women of childbearing potential if it is essential in the management of seizures.  If a patient becomes pregnant while taking trimethadione, termination should be considered. Data: The rate of fetal loss is reportedly as high as 87%. Valproic acid  (Depacon, Depakene, Depakote, Stavzor) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – D Pregnancy risk exposure:  http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org , 1-888-233-233 Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Lumbosacral spina bifida with meningomyelocele or meningocele, often accompanied by midfacial hypoplasia, deficient orbital ridge, prominent forehead, congenital heart disease, and decreased postnatal growth Clinical Consideration: Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.  Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.   Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate.  Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.  To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Data: Data from one study suggested that exposure to valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy may have changed the ultrastructure of the placenta by altering the migration of trophoblast cells. Another demonstrated that some of the effects may be due to alterations of folate metabolism.  Meador et al found that in utero exposure to valproate as compared with other antiepileptic agents is associated with a lower IQ in children. The study took place over 5 years in 25 epilepsy centers in the United States and the United Kingdom. The design was a prospective, observational, cohort study of pregnant women with epilepsy who took a single agent (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, valproate). The cohort study assessed the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children who were exposed in utero to several different antiepileptic drugs. A planned interim analysis conducted when the children were 3 years of age reported lower mean IQ scores in children with in utero valproic acid exposure compared with the other antiepileptic drugs. This association was dose-dependent. The investigators concluded that valproate should not be used as a first-line agent in women of childbearing potential. [ 22]   This interim analysis was updated in 2013 with data from children completing 6 years of follow-up. The final results of the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (NEAD) study showed that children exposed to valproate products while their mothers were pregnant had decreased IQs at age 6 compared to children exposed to other antiepileptic drugs. [ 41]  The prescribing information was changed to reflect this risk including a Black Box Warning stating not to use valproate derivatives in women of childbearing age unless the drug is essential to the management of seizures, or for manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (FDA fetal risk category D). It should not be used for migraine headache prophylaxis during pregnancy (FDA fetal risk category X). Discussion of Specific Agents: Psychiatric Medications Benzodiazepines  (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, halazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, quazepam, temezapam, trazolam) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - D or X.  Risk summary: Trimesters of risk: The first, second, and third trimesters are times or risk for flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam (category X). Chlordiazepoxide seems to be safe during pregnancy. Avoidance of alprazolam during pregnancy seems prudent.  Associated defects and complications - Unclear; potential for isolated oral cleft Clinical considerations: Certain benzodiazepines should be avoided in pregnancy, such as triazolam. Others should be used with caution, and only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Data: The information currently available is insufficient to determine whether the potential benefits of benzodiazepines to the mother outweigh the risks to the fetus. Pooled data from cohort studies show no association between fetal exposure to benzodiazepines and a risk of major malformations or oral cleft. However, pooled data from case-control studies demonstrated that the risk for major malformations is significantly increased, particularly for isolated oral cleft. Until additional research data are reported, level 2 ultrasonography is useful for assessing the patient for a cleft lip. Bupropion  (Wellbutrin, Zyban) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications – Unknown Clinical Consideration: Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment in pregnancy and postpartum Data: No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in reproductive developmental studies conducted in rats and rabbits; however, in rabbits, slightly increased incidences of fetal malformations and skeletal variations were observed at doses approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) and greater and decreased fetal weights were seen at doses twice the MRHD and greater. Bupropion should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data from the bupropion Pregnancy Registry and a retrospective cohort study using United Healthcare database did not show an increased risk for malformations overall. Duloxetine  (Cymbalta) Old categorization:  Pregnancy category – C. Pregnancy risk exposure: 1-866-814-6975,  www.cymbaltapregnancyregistry.com Risk summary: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of CYMBALTA administration in pregnant women. In animal studies with duloxetine, fetal weights were decreased but there was no evidence of teratogenicity in pregnant rats and rabbits at oral doses administered during the period of organogenesis up to 4 and 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 120 mg/day, respectively. When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout gestation and lactation, pup weights at birth and pup survival to 1 day postpartum were decreased at a dose 2 times the MRHD. At this dose, pup behaviors consistent with increased reactivity, such as increased startle response to noise and decreased habituation of locomotor activity were observed. Post-weaning growth was not adversely affected. Duloxetine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Clinical Considerations:  Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reaction  — Neonates exposed during pregnancy to serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding which can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of the SNRIs or SSRIs, or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome. Data:  Animal Data  — In animal reproduction studies, duloxetine has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development. When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, there was no evidence of teratogenicity at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 120 mg/day on a mg/m 2  basis, in rat; 7 times the MRHD in rabbit). However, fetal weights were decreased at this dose, with a no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day approximately equal to the MRHD in rats; 2 times the MRHD in rabbits). When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout gestation and lactation, the survival of pups to 1 day postpartum and pup body weights at birth and during the lactation period were decreased at a dose of30 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD); the no-effect dose was 10 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, behaviors consistent with increased reactivity, such as increased startle response to noise and decreased habituation of locomotor activity, were observed in pups following maternal exposure to 30 mg/kg/day. Post-weaning growth and reproductive performance of the progeny were not affected adversely by maternal duloxetine treatment. Fluoxetine  (Prozac) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Variable; possible self-limited neonatal behavioral syndrome Clinical considerations: Fetal/neonatal: Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 - 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiological studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including fluoxetine) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Data: Reports of more than 1000 pregnancies exposed to fluoxetine (Prozac; Eli Lilly and Company) during the first trimester have been recorded. No study revealed an increased risk for major structural birth defects (ie, those requiring surgery or reducing function). One study has shown an increased rate of 3 or more minor birth defects (i.e., those not medically or functionally significant) among children exposed to fluoxetine in the first trimester. When 3 or more minor birth defects are seen together, the likelihood of a major birth defect (including learning problems) increases, though this effect was not observed in the fluoxetine study. Follow-up studies have been started to investigate the possible long-term effects on infants exposed to fluoxetine during pregnancy. The available evidence indicates that in utero exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the last trimester through delivery may result in a self-limited neonatal behavioral syndrome that can be managed with supportive care. Conflicting evidence exists regarding use of SSRIs during pregnancy and increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. An initial Public Health Advisory in 2006 was based on a single retrospective study; since then, there have been conflicting findings from new studies, making it unclear whether use of SSRIs during pregnancy can cause PPHN. [ 23]  The FDA has reviewed the results of an additional new study and has concluded that, given the conflicting results from different studies, it is premature to reach any conclusion about a possible link between SSRI use in pregnancy and PPHN. The FDA is advising health care professionals not to alter their current clinical practice of treating depression during pregnancy and to report any adverse events to the FDA MedWatch program. [ 24]  See the list below: Animal Data —  In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of fluoxetine at doses up to 12.5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (1.5 and 3.6 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg on a mg/m 2  basis) throughout organogenesis. However, in rat reproduction studies, an increase in stillborn pups, a decrease in pup weight, and an increase in pup deaths during the first 7 days postpartum occurred following maternal exposure to 12 mg/kg/day (1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2  basis) during gestation or 7.5 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2  basis) during gestation and lactation. There was no evidence of developmental neurotoxicity in the surviving offspring of rats treated with 12 mg/kg/day during gestation. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was 5 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2  basis). Lithium Old categorization: Pregnancy category – D. Risk summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.   Associated defects and complications - Variable; possible cardiac effects, especially Ebstein’s anomaly. Clinical consideration: If the patient becomes pregnant while taking lithium, she should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus. If possible, lithium should be withdrawn for at least the first trimester unless it is determined that this would seriously endanger the mother. Data: In 1973, an International Register of Lithium Babies was established to monitor the outcome of fetuses exposed in the first trimester of pregnancy. As of 1990, 225 cases were registered, with 25 instances of malformation. Of these, 18 involved the great vessels of the heart. Six were Ebstein anomalies, defects affecting the tricuspid valve. These numbers suggest a greatly increased risk compared with the normal frequency of Ebstein anomaly (1 in 20,000 births). However, this claim has been contested on the grounds of over reporting of abnormal cases and because 2 studies returned negative findings. The question remains whether lithium is a human teratogen. The best estimate comes from cohort studies, one of which suggested an increased rate (4-12%) of congenital malformations compared with the rate observed in the general population (2-4%). In 1992, a prospective study of pregnancy outcomes after exposure to lithium carbonate during the first trimester of pregnancy was reported. [ 25]  In it, 138 patients were successfully followed up to the end of pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations was the same between lithium-exposed subjects (2.8%) and maternal age-matched control subjects (2.4%). However, 1 Ebstein anomaly was reported in the lithium group. Birth weight was notably increased in the lithium group despite identical gestational ages. One cohort study showed positive relative risks of 3 for all types of congenital malformations and 7.7 for cardiac malformations. None of the subjects had an Ebstein anomaly. Findings from a second cohort study were negative. Four case-control studies performed to test the association between lithium and Ebstein anomaly have also been reported. No cases of Ebstein anomaly were observed in 208 lithium-exposed embryos, though 2 cases were found among 398 control subjects. Ramelteon  (Rozerem) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications – Unknown Clinical Consideration: Ramelteon should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies have been performed in pregnant women.  Oral administration of ramelteon (10, 40, 150 or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities (malformations and variations) at doses greater than 40 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is approximately 50 times the RHD on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (or up to 720 times the RHD on a mg/m 2  basis Paroxetine  (Paxil) Old categorization: Category D Risk Summary: Trimester of risk: first.  Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. Data: A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those who require surgery. -- ]]> A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the odds ratio was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). Discussion of Specific Agents: Respiratory Medications Leukotriene receptor antagonists  (montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - B Risk summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown. Associated defects and complications – Congenital limb defects have been rarely reported in offspring of women being treated with montelukast (Singlulair, Merck) during pregnancy. Clinical consideration: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, they should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Data: In a study by Bakhireva et al, perinatal outcomes among 96 women who took montelukast or zafirlukast were compared with those of 122 women who exclusively took short-acting beta2-agonists and 346 women without asthma. 27  No specific pattern of major structural anomalies in their offspring or a large risk of other adverse perinatal outcomes was found. Animal data -  Teratogenic Effect:  No teratogenicity was observed in rats and rabbits at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults based on AUCs. Tiotropium bromide  (Spiriva) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Unknown Clinical Consideration: Tiotropium bromide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus Data: No evidence of structural alterations was observed in rats and rabbits at dosages of inhalation tiotropium (Spiriva HandiHaler; Pfizer Inc and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT) of up to 1.471 and 0.007 mg/kg/d, respectively. These dosages corresponded to approximately 660 and 6 times RHDD on a milligram-per–square meter basis, respectively. However, in rats, fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation were observed at inhalation dosages of 0.078 mg/kg (approximately 35 times the RHDD on a milligram-per–square meter basis). In rabbits, an increase in postimplantation loss was observed at an inhalation dosage of 0.4 mg/kg/d (approximately 360 times the RHDD on a milligram-per–square meter basis). Such effects were not observed at inhalation dosages of 0.009 and up to 0.088 mg/kg/d in rats and rabbits, respectively. These doses corresponded to approximately 4 and 80 times the RHDD on a milligram-per–square meter basis, respectively. These dosage multiples may have been overestimated because of difficulties in measuring deposited doses in animal inhalation studies. No adequate and well-controlled studies have been performed in pregnant women.  The safety and effectiveness of tiotropium has not been studied during labor and delivery. Discussion of Specific Agents: Oncologic and antineoplastic medications Antineoplastics  (busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, mechlorethamine) Old categorization: Pregnancy categories - D and X Risk summery: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications: Observed problems included IUGR, cleft palate, renal agenesis, digital malformations, cardiac anomalies, and cloudy corneas. First-trimester exposure to antimetabolites (aminopterin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, methylaminopterin, and cytarabine) produced a risk for cleft lip and palate, low-set ears, cranial anomalies, and anencephaly. Data: Case series show that 10-50% of fetuses exposed to antineoplastic alkylating agents are malformed. The malformation rate for first-trimester exposure is 11.6%. Only case reports are available for antineoplastic antimetabolites; however, a mean of 40% of neonates were malformed. Lenalidomide  (Revlimid) Old categorization: Pregnancy category – X Pregnancy risk exposure: 1-888-423-5436 Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Possible reduction in fetal body weight and increase in post-implantation losses and fetal variations Clinical considerations: Fetal – Lenalidomide (Revlimid, Celgene) is a thalidomide analog. Thalidomide is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. Data: Animal data.  In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in monkeys, teratogenicity, including thalidomide-like limb defects, occurred in offspring when pregnant monkeys received oral lenalidomide during organogenesis.  Exposure (AUC) in monkeys at the lowest dose was 0.17 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg.  Similar studies in pregnant rabbits and rats at 20 times and 200 times the MRHD, respectively, produced lethality in rabbits and n adverse reproductive effects in rats.   In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals received lenalidomide from organogenesis through lactation. The study revealed a few adverse effects on the offspring of female rats treated with lenalidomide at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the human dose of 25 mg based on body surface area). The male offspring exhibited slightly delayed sexual maturation and the female offspring had slightly lower body weight gains during gestation when bred to male offspring. As with thalidomide, the rat model may not adequately address the full spectrum of potential human embryo-fetal developmental effects for lenalidomide. Mycophenolate mofetil  (Cellcept) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – D Pregnancy risk exposure: http://www.ntpr.giftoflifeinstitute.org Risk Summary: Trimester of risk - First \t\t Associated defects and complications - External ear and facial defects; cleft lip and palate; heart, esophagus, kidney and distal limb defects.  Associated with increased of first trimester pregnancy loss. Clinical Consideration: Women of childbearing potential should receive contraceptive counseling and use effective contraception starting 4 weeks prior to initiating therapy.  Women using mycophenolate mofetil at any time during pregnancy should be encouraged to enroll in the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry. Data: The pregnancy category of mycophenolate mofetil was recently changed from C (risk of fetal harm from the drug cannot be ruled out) to D (existing evidence of fetal risk). Previous studies showed supporting results; most studies involved the use of mycophenolate mofetil during the preconception period and the first trimester. Pemetrexed  (Alimta) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Unknown Clinical Consideration: Pemetrexed may cause harm when administered to pregnant women.  Lactating women should discontinue nursing if being treated with pemetrexed.  Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies of pemetrexed (Alimta; Eli Lilly and Company) have been performed in pregnant women. Fetotoxic and teratogenic in mice at i.p. doses of 0.2 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) or 5 mg/kg (15 mg/m2) when given on gestation days 6 through 15. Pemetrexed caused fetal malformations (incomplete ossification of talus and skull bone) at 0.2 mg/kg (about 1/833 the recommended i.v. human dose on a mg/m2 basis), and cleft palate at 5 mg/kg (about 1/33 the recommended i.v. human dose on a mg/m2 basis).  Embryotoxicity was characterized by increased embryo-fetal deaths and reduced litter sizes. Thalidomide  (Thalomid) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – X Pregnancy risk exposure: Report any suspected fetal exposure to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the Celgene Corporation at 1-888-423-5436. Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third \t\t Associated defects and complications - Malformed intestines, hearing defects, absent ears, and/or ocular and renal anomalies, phocomelia Clinical Consideration: If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  The drug should be immediately discontinued. Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control simultaneously.  Males exposed to thalidomide must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential and for up to 28 days after discontinuing. Data: Many mechanisms of action have been proposed for thalidomide, yet the true mechanism remains unknown. One theory suggests that neural crest cells are affected. Another mentions an alteration in metanephros-limb interaction that stunts the limb’s outgrowth. Other possibilities include a reduction in the size of ganglia (which inhibits limb development because limb growth depends on neuronal growth) or an inhibition of cell-to-cell interactions and reduced quantities of cell adhesion molecules; these alterations make limb growth impossible. --In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in monkeys, teratogenicity, including thalidomide-like limb defects, occurred in offspring when pregnant monkeys received oral lenalidomide during organogenesis. Exposure (AUC) in monkeys at the lowest dose was 0.17 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg. Similar studies in pregnant rabbits and rats at 20 times and 200 times the MRHD respectively, produced embryo lethality in rabbits and no adverse reproductive effects in rats. Discussion of Specific Agents: Musculoskeletal and Rheumatic medications Colchicine Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk category: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Generally unknown; potential chromosome aberrations. Clinical considerations: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in  pregnant  women. Colchicine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the  fetus . Data: Colchicine has been shown to cause birth defects in animals. Only a few reports describe it as causing birth defects in humans. Occasional cases of trisomy or aneuploidy have been reported in patients being treated with colchicine for gout. A causal relationship is uncertain. Some early studies suggested an increase in Down's syndrome, but that association appears to be coincidental. In a study of 28 women with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) who were taking colchicine, 25% had miscarriages and 36% had periods of infertility. These rates were high but similar to rates reported for women with FMF without colchicine. All 16 babies born to the FMF women on colchicine were healthy. Pregnant patients with FMF who are receiving colchicine, may need to be monitored to determine renal function during pregnancy. A summary of 3 studies showed 4 of 14 men taking colchicine developed reversible azoospermia. When tested in mice given 1.25 to 1.5 mg/kg and hamsters given 10 mg/kg, colchicine was shown to be teratogenic. The drug can lower sperm counts and cause sperm defects, affecting the ploidy of sperm and resulting in birth defects. Ibandronate  (Boniva) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown. Associated defects and complications – Unknown. Clinical considerations: There is a theoretical risk of fetal harm (skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (oral vs iv) on this risk has not been established. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women with Boniva (Roche). Animal data: In female rats given ibandronate orally at doses greater than or equal to 3 times human exposure at the recommended daily oral dose of 2.5 mg or greater than or equal to 1 times human exposure at the recommended once-monthly oral dose of 150 mg beginning 14 days before mating and continuing through lactation, maternal deaths were observed at the time of delivery in all dose groups. Perinatal pup loss in dams given 45 times human exposure at the recommended daily dose and 13 times the recommended once-monthly dose was likely related to maternal dystocia. Calcium supplementation did not completely prevent dystocia and periparturient mortality in any of the treated groups at greater than or equal to 16 times the recommended daily dose and greater than or equal to 4.6 times the recommended once-monthly dose. A low incidence of postimplantation loss was observed in rats treated from 14 days before mating throughout lactation or during gestation, only at doses causing maternal dystocia and periparturient mortality. In pregnant rats dosed orally from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21 (following closure of the hard palate through weaning), maternal toxicity, including dystocia and mortality, fetal perinatal and postnatal mortality, were observed at doses equivalent to human exposure at the recommended daily and greater than or equal to 4 times the recommended once-monthly dose. Periparturient mortality has also been observed with other bisphosphonates and appears to be a class effect related to inhibition of skeletal calcium mobilization resulting in hypocalcemia and dystocia Penicillamine  (Depen, Cuprimine) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk Summary: Trimester of risk - Unknown \t\t Associated defects and complications - Variable; possible connective-tissue defects, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, skeletal defects, cleft palates, and fetal toxicity (resorptions) Clinical Consideration: Except for the treatment of Wilson’s disease or certain patients with cystinuria, use of penicillamine during pregnancy is contraindicated.  For patients with Wilson’s disease, it is recommended that the daily dosage be limited to 750 mg.  If cesarean delivery is planned, the daily dose should be reduced to 250 mg, but not lower, for the last 6 weeks of pregnancy and post-operatively until wound healing is complete.  Mothers using penicillamine should not nurse their infants.  Women on therapy with penicillamine who are of childbearing potential should be advised to report promptly any possible pregnancy and followed closely for early recognition of pregnancy. Data: No controlled studies have been conducted on the use of penicillamine in pregnant women. Although normal outcomes have been reported, characteristic congenital cutis laxa and associated birth defects have been reported in infants born of mothers who received therapy with penicillamine during pregnancy. Penicillamine has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 6 times higher than the highest dose recommended for human use. Skeletal defects, cleft palates and fetal toxicity (resorptions) have been reported. Discussion of Specific Agents: Genitourinary medications Misoprostol  (Cytotec, Arthrotec) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - X Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Möbius syndrome.  Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Clinical Consideration: Cytotec should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) when administered to pregnant women.  Caution should be exercised when administered to nursing women. Data: In a case-control study, researchers compared the frequency of misoprostol use during the first trimester between mothers of 96 Brazilian infants with Möbius syndrome and mothers of 96 infants with neural tube defects. Among the former, 47 (49%) had taken misoprostol during pregnancy, compared with just 3 (3%) of the mothers from the other group. Other investigators have stated that misoprostol use causes a 30-fold increase in the prevalence of Möbius syndrome, though this effect is still rare. Solifenacin succinate  (Vesicare) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Unknown Clinical Consideration: Pregnant women should not take solifenacin succinate, and women should not become pregnant while taking solifenacin succinate without first consulting a physician.  Women who are breastfeeding should not take solifenacin succinate without first talking to their physician Data: Whether solifenacin succinate (VESIcare; GlaxoSmithKline and Astellas Pharma US, Inc, Deerfield, IL) is harmful to an unborn baby is not known. After oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice, drug-related material was shown to cross the placental barrier. No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Trospium chloride  (Sanctura) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Unknown Clinical Consideration: Based on animal data, trospium chloride is predicted to have a low probability of increased risk of adverse developmental outcomes, above background risk.  Trospium chloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus. It should be used during lactation only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the newborn. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies have been performed in pregnant women. Trospium chloride (Sanctura; Esprit Pharmaceuticals, East Brunswick, NJ, and Indevus Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lexington, MA) has been shown to cause maternal toxicity and decrease fetal survival in rats given approximately 10 times the expected clinical exposure (AUC). No-effect levels for maternal and fetal toxicity were approximately equivalent to the expected clinical exposure in rats and were approximately 5-6 times the expected clinical exposure in rabbits. No malformations or developmental delays were observed. Trospium chloride 2 mg/kg given orally and 50 mcg/kg given intravenously were excreted to a limited extent (< 1%) into the milk of lactating rats. The activity observed in the milk was primarily from the parent compound. Whether this drug is excreted in human milk is not known. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when trospium chloride is administered to a nursing woman.   Discussion of Specific Agents: Gastrointestinal medications Ondansetron  (Zofran) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - B Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - Unknown \t\t Associated defects and complications – Unknown. Possible cleft lip and/or palate, possible cardiac septum Clinical Consideration: Ondansetron should not be used as a first line agent for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Data: Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 4 mg/kg per day (approximately 1.4 and 2.9 times the recommended human intravenous dose of 0.15 mg/kg given three times a day, respectively, based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ondansetron. A prospective comparative observational study from TIS (Teratogen Information Services) in 2004 found no increased risk for major malformations above baseline risks. Sulfasalazine  (Azulifidine, Sulfazine) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – B Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk: unknown \t\t Associated defects and complications- unknown Clinical Consideration: Sulfasalazine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Data: Researchers in Iran performed a meta-analysis to explore the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD following exposure to 5-ASA drugs (mesalazine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide, and olsalazine). This meta-analysis suggests that women taking 5-ASA drugs had no more than a 1.16-fold increase in congenital malformations, a 2.38-fold increase in stillbirth, a 1.14-fold increase in spontaneous abortion, a 1.35-fold increase in preterm delivery, and a 0.93-fold increase in low birth weight. [ 26]  Rifaximin  (Xifaxan) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Possible cleft palate, agnathia, jaw-shortening, hemorrhage, eyes partially open, small eyes, brachygnathia, incomplete ossification, and increased thoracolumbar vertebrae Clinical Consideration: Advise women of the potential risk to the fetus. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies have been performed in pregnant women. Rifaximin (Xifaxan; Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Morrisville, NC) was teratogenic in rats at doses of 150-300 mg/kg (approximately 2.5-5 times the clinical dose adjusted for body surface area) and in rabbits at doses of 62.5-1000 mg/kg (approximately 2-33 times the clinical dose adjusted for body surface area). Discussion of Specific Agents: Endocrine medications Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and hormone replacement  Old categorization: Pregnancy category – X See the list below: Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Variable; inflammatory complications common. There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use combined oral contraceptives during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy. See the list below: Clinical consideration: Stop taking the oral contraceptives or hormone replacement as soon as a positive pregnancy test is noted. Data: Little direct data are available because of the lack of models for estrogen-deficient pregnancy. Corticosteroids  (Betamethasone, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone, triamcinolone) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk summary: Trimester of risk – First. Associated defects and complications - Reduced birth weight, increased risk of preeclampsia, and increased risk of oral and lip clefts. Clinical considerations: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism Data: A study of 35 women demonstrated various defects in 9 infants. Concerns have been expressed that neonatal adrenal hyperplasia or insufficiency may result from maternal corticosteroid use. The meaning of these results is uncertain. The Collaborative Perinatal Project monitored 50,282 mother-child pairs, 34 of whom had first-trimester exposure to cortisone. No evidence of a relationship to congenital defects was observed. Danazol  (Danocrine) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - X Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications: Danazol can cause virilization of the external genital organs, and it has been linked to pseudohermaphroditism. Clinical consideration: Recommend against use in pregnancy due to the risk of virilization. Data: Clinical findings suggest the development of salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In one child, basal levels of the adrenal steroids were normal after 1 year. It may be hypothesized that danazol transiently blocked the steroid 21- and 11-beta-monooxygenases in this child. Reversible oligospermia may occur in adult males after prolonged administration or excessive dosage. If this effect occurs, danazol can be discontinued and if restarted, a lower dosage should be utilized. Estradiol gel 0.06 %  (Estrogel, Elestrin) Old categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Decrease in the quantity and quality of milk Clinical considerations: There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as an oral contraceptive inadvertently during early pregnancy. Data: No adequate and well-controlled studies of estradiol gel 0.06% (EstroGel; ASCEND Therapeutics, Inc, Herndon, VA) have been performed in pregnant women. Exenatide  (Byetta, Bydureon) Old categorization: Pregnancy category – C Pregnancy risk exposure: 1-800-633-9081 Risk summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown. Associated defects and complications - Possible skeletal effects Clinical considerations: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of exenatide use in pregnant women. In animal studies, exenatide caused cleft palate, irregular skeletal ossification and an increased number of neonatal deaths. Exenatide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data:  Female mice given SC doses of 6, 68, or 760 mcg/kg/day beginning 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 7 had no adverse fetal effects. At the maximal dose, 760 mcg/kg/day, systemic exposures were up to 390 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg/day, based on AUC. In developmental toxicity studies, pregnant animals received exenatide subcutaneously during organogenesis. Specifically, fetuses from pregnant rabbits given SC doses of 0.2, 2, 22, 156, or 260 mcg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through 18 experienced irregular skeletal ossifications from exposures 12 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg/day, based on AUC. Moreover, fetuses from pregnant mice given SC doses of 6, 68, 460, or 760 mcg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through 15 demonstrated reduced fetal and neonatal growth, cleft palate and skeletal effects at systemic exposure 3 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg/day, based on AUC. Methimazole  Old categorization: Pregnancy category – D Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, possibly second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Prematurity, small-for-gestational-age infants, and scalp defects (aplasia cutitis); possible choanal and esophageal atresia, absent or hypoplastic nipples Clinical considerations:  If a patient is using this drug, it may be better to switch to another drug to control her hyperthyroidism in the first trimester, until organogenesis is completed, as this crossed the placenta.  In pregnant women with untreated or inadequately treated Graves’ disease, there is an increased risk of adverse events of maternal heart failure, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth and fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism. Data: One study indicated that the prevalence of choanal and esophageal atresia may be higher than expected in fetuses exposed to methimazole during gestational weeks 3-7. Some researchers gave stated that no deleterious effects on thyroid function or on the physical and intellectual development occurred when mothers were treated with dosages up to 20 mg/d during pregnancy. Propylthiouracil can be used instead. Mifepristone, RU-486  (RU-486, Mifeprex, Korlym) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Unknown; possible sexual function Clinical Consideration: Mifepristone is indicated for the termination of pregnancy through 49 days and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Data: Whether mifepristone has teratogenic effects is not known for certain. Children whose mothers used it have been born without birth defects. However, experiments in rats have shown different results. Rats that were exposed to the drug were born normal in one study. However, in another study, sexual function was affected. Therefore, this medication appears to impart some increase in an undefined risk if it is ingested during pregnancy. Potassium iodide Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - D Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Hypoplasia, goiter Clinical Consideration: Transplacental passage can cause severe and possibly irreversible hypothyroidism in neonates.  Women and men of childbearing potential should use two forms of effective contraception to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months after administration of I-131.  Lactating women should not breastfeed. Data: Studies have shown that medications containing potassium iodide (as a radiocontrast agent) can affect the fetal thyroid gland and lead to hypoplasia and goiter. Progesterones  (medroxyprogesterone/Provera, norethindrone/Micronor/aygestin, prometrium) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category \t\t Medroxyprogesterone acetate- X Norethindrone- X Prometrium- B Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third.  Associated defects and complications - Possible cardiovascular defects, hypospadias Clinical Consideration: Progesterones should not be used during pregnancy Data: Various forms of progesterone are used as contraceptive agents and are classified as pregnancy category D or X. They have been linked to birth defects (eg, cardiovascular defects, hypospadias), but this has not been proven. Discussion of Specific Agents: Other Finasteride  (Propecia, Proscar) Old categorizartion: Pregnancy category – X Risk summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Abnormalities of the sex organs Data: Studies in animals demonstrated that pregnancies sired by male rats given large doses of finasteride did not result in offspring born with birth defects. As of this writing, no such studies have been conducted in humans. Animal studies have shown that pregnant monkeys given large doses of oral finasteride had male offspring with abnormalities of the sex organs. Although highly unlikely, a theoretical risk exists for birth defects of a male fetus' sex organs if a man taking finasteride has intercourse during the stage of pregnancy when the sex organs are developing (8-15 wks of gestation). However, the amount of the drug found in the semen is small and not considered to be enough to harm a male baby. Folic acid antagonists  (aminopterin, carbamazepine, cimetidine, methotrexate, pemetrexed, phenytoin, phenobarbital, proguanil, pyrimethamine, sulfasalazine, triamterene, trimethoprim, valproic acid) Old categorization: Pregnancy category – some are D, some are X Risk summary: Trimester of risk - First, during normal closure of the fetal neural tube. Associated defects and complications - Variable; neural tube defects Data: Dietary factors, such as cholesterol and folic acid, appear to be critical for normal closure of the fetal neural tube. Approximately 50% of neural tube defects can be prevented. To prevent them, a pregnant woman should take supplemental folic acid. The US Public Health Service recommends that all women of childbearing age take 0.4 mg of folic acid per day. The following drugs interfere with folic acid metabolism: \t\t Phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin; Parke-Davis, Division of Pfizer Inc), carbamazepine (Tegretol; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ), and primidone (Mysoline; Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Aliso Viejo, CA) - Primarily used to prevent seizures. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and mental deficiency have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have also been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and/or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. However, the relative contributions of antiepileptic drugs and other factors associated with epilepsy to this increased risk are uncertain and in most cases it has not been possible to attribute specific developmental abnormalities to particular antiepileptic drugs. Antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and a sulfonamide (eg, Bactrim; AR Scientific, Philadelphia, PA, and Septra; Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Bristol, TN) - Commonly used to treat urinary tract infections. While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. Triamterene (Dyrenium; WellSpring Pharmaceutical Corporation, Bradenton, FL) - Diuretic used to treat high blood pressure Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine; Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Division of Pfizer Inc) - Used to manage ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory conditions Valproic acid (Depakote; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) Cimetidine (Tagamet; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) - Used to treat ulcers and acid reflux Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers - Used to manage high blood pressure and certain heart disorders Cholestyramine (LoCholest; Warner Chilcott Laboratories, Rockaway, NJ, and Questran; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) - Used to lower cholesterol levels The prevalence of birth defects after use of the drugs listed above is highly variable. Defects can often be prevented with folic acid supplementation. Anticonvulsant medications on this list can cause a host of birth defects independent of their effects on folic acid. Methylene blue Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - C Risk Summary: Trimester of risk – Unknown.  Associated defects and complications - Intestinal atresias Clinical Consideration: Safety for use in pregnancy has not been established.  Use in women of childbearing potential requires benefits be weighed against hazards. Data: Methylene blue is reported to cause intestinal atresias when it is injected into the amniotic fluid during amniocentesis. It poses a small risk of causing birth defects. Retinoids  (Absorica, Accutane, Isotretinoin) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category – X Pregnancy risk exposure: Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via MedWatch (1-800-FDA-1088) and also iPLEDGE pregnancy registry (1-866-495-0654 or  www.ipledgeprogram.com Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk: The first, second, and third trimesters are times of risk. The critical window of exposure is at 3-5 weeks of pregnancy. \t\t Associated defects and complications - Deformities of the cranium, ears, face, limbs, and liver; hydrocephalus; microcephalus; heart defects; cognitive defects without dysmorphology; craniofacial alterations; cleft palate; neural tube defects; cardiovascular malformations; thymic aplasia; psychological impairments; absent or defective ears; small jaw; and kidney alterations Clinical Consideration: Female patients of childbearing potential must use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously.  If pregnancy occurs, the drug must be stopped.). Data: Retinoic acid is teratogenic in humans at low doses. Of affected children, 50% have an intelligence quotient (IQ) of less than 85. The mean IQ score is 100-110. Retinoic acid is the active ingredient in Accutane (Roche Laboratories Inc, Nutley, NJ), a drug used to treat severe acne. Since its introduction in September 1982, an estimated 160,000 women of childbearing age have used it. From 1982-1987, approximately 900-1300 malformed children, 700-1000 spontaneous abortions, and 5000-7000 elective abortions were attributed to exposure to this drug. Exposed children may have had hydrocephaly, ear malformations, cardiovascular defects, and decreased IQ scores. Accutane carries a pregnancy category X warning; it is a known human teratogen. Dosages of 25,000 IU/d or more, given in the form of retinol or retinyl esters, should be considered potentially teratogenic. Another strategy involves the administration of drugs during pregnancy while accounting for its pharmacologic effects in relation to the gestational period. Examples are avoidance of chemotherapy during the first trimester, avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the third trimester, avoidance of high doses of benzodiazepines in the period when events are imminent. Only a minimal amount of tazarotene is absorbed into the circulation. Warfarin  (Coumadin) Old Categorization: Pregnancy category - X Risk Summary: Trimesters of risk - First, second, and third. Associated defects and complications - Deformities of the axial and appendicular skeleton; also, a hypoplastic nose, eye abnormalities, mental retardation, brachydactyly, and scoliosis. Clinical Consideration: Warfarin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism. Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating warfarin therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 1 month after the final dose. Data: Malformations are reported in 16% of exposed fetuses; hemorrhages, in 3%; and stillbirths, in 8%. The embryopathy described above results from maternal use during early pregnancy, whereas CNS disorders are due to ingestion at a later stage in pregnancy. The teratogenic mechanism of warfarin is unknown, but one proposed theory is that an alteration in posttranslational carboxylation of proteins may result in the chondrogenic disorders. ",

				"body": "Overview Practice Essentials Hepatitis C is an infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that attacks the liver and leads to inflammation. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 3% of the world’s population has been infected with HCV and that there are more than 170 million chronic carriers who are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The image below depicts the HCV genome. Hepatitis C viral genome. Courtesy of Hepatitis Resource Network.  Hepatitis C viral genome. Courtesy of Hepatitis Resource Network.  Signs and symptoms Initial symptoms of hepatitis C are often extrahepatic, most commonly involving the joints, muscle, and skin. Examples include the following: Arthralgias Paresthesias Myalgias Pruritus Sicca syndrome Sensory neuropathy Symptoms characteristic of complications from advanced or decompensated liver disease are related to synthetic dysfunction and  portal hypertension , such as the following: Mental status changes ( hepatic encephalopathy ) Ankle edema and abdominal distention ( ascites ) Hematemesis or melena ( variceal bleeding ) Physical findings usually are not abnormal until portal hypertension or decompensated liver disease develops. Signs in patients with decompensated liver disease include the following: Hand signs: Palmar erythema,  Dupuytren contracture , asterixis, leukonychia, clubbing Head signs: Icteric sclera, temporal muscle wasting, enlarged parotid gland, cyanosis Fetor hepaticus Gynecomastia, small testes Abdominal signs: Paraumbilical hernia, ascites, caput medusae, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal bruit Ankle edema Scant body hair Skin signs: Spider nevi, petechiae, excoriations due to pruritus Other common extrahepatic manifestations include the following: Cryoglobulinemia: Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Lichen planus [ 1]  Keratoconjunctivitis sicca Raynaud syndrome Sjögren syndrome Porphyria cutanea tarda Necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis Non-Hodgkin lymphoma See  Clinical Presentation  for more detail. See  5 Body Modifications and Piercing: Dermatologic Risks and Adverse Reactions , a Critical Images slideshow, to help recognize various body modifications and the related potential complications. Diagnosis General baseline studies in patients with suspected hepatitis C include the following: Complete blood cell count with differential Liver function tests, including alanine aminotransferase level Thyroid function studies Screening tests for coinfection with  HIV  or  hepatitis B virus (HBV) Screening for alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or depression Tests for detecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection include the following: Hepatitis C antibody testing: Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and point-of-care tests (POCTs) Recombinant immunoblot assay Qualitative and quantitative assays for HCV RNA (based on polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or transmission-mediated amplification [TMA]) HCV genotyping Serologic testing (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is a common finding) Liver biopsy  is not mandatory before treatment but may be helpful. Some restrict it to the following situations: The diagnosis is uncertain Other coinfections or disease may be present The patient has normal liver enzyme levels and no extrahepatic manifestations The patient is immunocompromised See  Workup  for more detail. Management Treatment of acute hepatitis C has rapidly evolved See  Treatment  and  Medication  for more detail. Background Hepatitis C is a worldwide problem. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of both acute and chronic hepatitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 3% of the world’s population has been infected with HCV and that there are more than 170 million chronic carriers who are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The prevalence of HCV infection varies throughout the world. For example, Frank et al reported in 2000 that Egypt had the highest number of reported infections, largely attributed to the use of contaminated parenteral antischistosomal therapy. [ 2]  This led to a mean prevalence of HCV antibodies in persons in Egypt of 22%. In the United States, the incidence of acute HCV infection has sharply decreased during the past decade. Its prevalence remains high (approximately 2.7 million Americans), however, because chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection develops in approximately 75% of patients after acute infection. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 1.8% of the US population is positive for HCV antibodies. Because 3 of 4 seropositive persons are also viremic, this corresponds to an estimated 2.7 million people with active HCV infection nationwide. Infection due to HCV accounts for 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis, an estimated 30,000 new acute infections, and 8000-10,000 deaths each year in the United States. HCV has rapidly surpassed HIV as a cause of death in the US. An examination of nearly 22 million death records over 9 years revealed an HCV mortality rate of 4.58 deaths per 100,000 people per year and an HIV mortality rate of 4.16 deaths per 100,000 people. Almost 75% of HCV deaths occurred among adults between the ages of 45 and 64. [ 3]  Medical care costs associated with the treatment of HCV infection in the United States are estimated to be more than $600 million a year. Most patients infected with HCV have chronic liver disease, which can progress to  cirrhosis  and  hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC). Chronic infection with HCV is one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease (see the image below) and, according to a report by Davis et al, the most common indication for orthotopic  liver transplantation  (OLT) in the United States. [ 4]  Hepatitis C. Causes of chronic liver disease. Courtesy of the US Centers for Disease Control and... Hepatitis C. Causes of chronic liver disease. Courtesy of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Most patients with acute and chronic infection are asymptomatic. Patients and health care providers may detect no indications of the conditions for long periods; however, chronic hepatitis C infection and chronic active hepatitis are slowly progressive diseases and result in severe morbidity in 20-30% of infected persons. Astute observation and integration of findings of extrahepatic symptoms, signs, and disease are often the first clues to underlying HCV infection. [ 5]  Although acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is usually mild, chronic hepatitis results in at least 75% of patients. [ 6]  (See Prognosis.) While liver enzyme levels may be in the reference range, the presence of persistent HCV-RNA levels discloses chronic infection. Biopsy samples of the liver may reveal chronic liver disease in patients. Cirrhosis develops in 20-50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma can eventually result. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 11-19% of patients. Pathophysiology The cause of hepatitis C, HCV, is a spherical, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family and  Flavivirus  genus. The natural targets of HCV are hepatocytes and, possibly, B lymphocytes. Viral clearance is associated with the development and persistence of strong virus-specific responses by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T cells. In most infected people, viremia persists and is accompanied by variable degrees of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Findings from studies suggest that at least 50% of hepatocytes may be infected with HCV in patients with chronic hepatitis C. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme critical in HCV replication, lacks proofreading capabilities and generates a large number of mutant viruses known as quasispecies. These represent minor molecular variations with only 1-2% nucleotide heterogeneity. HCV quasispecies pose a major challenge to immune-mediated control of HCV and may explain the variable clinical course and the difficulties in vaccine development. Etiology Hepatitis C is caused by a spherical, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus  Flavivirus . Lauer and Walker reported that HCV is closely related to hepatitis G, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. HCV can produce at least 10 trillion new viral particles each day. The HCV genome consists of a single, open reading frame and 2 untranslated, highly conserved regions, 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR, at both ends of the genome. The genome has approximately 9500 base pairs and encodes a single polyprotein of 3011 amino acids that are processed into 10 structural and regulatory proteins (see the image below). Hepatitis C viral genome. Courtesy of Hepatitis Resource Network.  Hepatitis C viral genome. Courtesy of Hepatitis Resource Network.  Structural components include the core and 2 envelope proteins, E1 and E2. Two regions of the E2 protein, designated hypervariable regions 1 and 2, have an extremely high rate of mutation, thought to result from selective pressure by virus-specific antibodies. The envelope protein E2 also contains the binding site for CD-81, a tetraspanin receptor expressed on hepatocytes and B lymphocytes that acts as a receptor or coreceptor for HCV. The nonstructural components include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B, and p7, whose proteins function as helicase-, protease-, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, although the exact function of p7 is unknown. One region within NS5A is linked to an interferon (IFN) response and is called the IFN sensitivity–determining region. These enzymes are critical in viral replication and are attractive targets for future antiviral therapy. HCV genomic analysis by means of arduous gene sequencing of many viruses has led to the division of HCV into 6 genotypes based on homology. Numerous subtypes have also been identified. Arabic numerals denote the genotype, and lower-case letters denote the subtypes for lesser homology within each genotype. [ 6]  Genotypes Molecular differences between genotypes are relatively large, and they have a difference of at least 30% at the nucleotide level. The major HCV genotype worldwide is genotype 1, which accounts for 40-80% of all isolates. Genotype 1 also may be associated with more severe liver disease and a higher risk of HCC. Genotypes 1a and 1b are prevalent in the United States, whereas in other countries, genotype 1a is less frequent. HCV genotype 1, particularly 1b, does not respond to therapy as well as genotypes 2 and 3. Genotype details are as follows: Genotype 1a occurs in 50-60% of patients in the United States Genotype 1b occurs in 15-20% of patients in the United States; this type is most prevalent in Europe, Turkey, and Japan Genotype 1c occurs in less than 1% of patients in the United States Genotypes 2a, 2b, and 2c occur in 10-15% of patients in the United States; these subtypes are widely distributed and are most responsive to medication Genotypes 3a and 3b occur in 4-6% of patients in the United States; these subtypes are most prevalent in India, Pakistan, Thailand, Australia, and Scotland Genotype 4 occurs in less than 5% of patients in the United States; it is most prevalent in the Middle East and Africa Genotype 5 occurs in less than 5% of patients in the United States; it is most prevalent in South Africa Genotype 6 occurs in less than 5% of patients in the United States; it is most prevalent in Southeast Asia, particularly Hong Kong and Macao Within a region, a specific genotype may also be associated with a specific mode of transmission, such as genotype 3 among persons in Scotland who abuse intravenous drugs. Transmission Transfusion of blood contaminated with HCV was once an important source of transmission. Since 1990, however, the screening of donated blood for HCV antibody has decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection to less than 1 case in 103,000 transfused units. With the use of more sensitive assays, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Stramer et al reported that the risk of acquiring HCV from blood transfusions is estimated to be 1 in 230,000 donations. [ 7]  The newer assays have decreased the window after infection to 1-2 weeks. Persons who inject illegal drugs with nonsterile needles or who snort cocaine with shared straws are at highest risk for HCV infection. In developed countries, most new HCV infections are related to intravenous drug abuse (IVDA). Transmission of HCV to health care workers may occur via needle-stick injuries or other occupational exposures. Needle-stick injuries in the health care setting result in a 3% risk of HCV transmission. According to Rischitelli et al, however, the prevalence of HCV infection among health care workers is similar to that of the general population. [ 8]  Nosocomial patient-to-patient transmission may occur by means of a contaminated colonoscope, via dialysis, or during surgery, including organ transplantation before 1992. HCV may also be transmitted via tattooing, sharing razors, and acupuncture. The use of disposable needles for acupuncture, which has become standard practice in the United States, eliminates this transmission route. Yeung et al reported that uncommon routes of transmission of HCV, which affect less than 5% of the individuals at risk, include high-risk sexual activity and maternal-fetal transmission. [ 9]  Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 appears to increase the risk of both sexual and maternal-fetal transmission of HCV. Casual household contact and contact with the saliva of those infected are inefficient modes of transmission. No risk factors are identified in approximately 10% of cases. Epidemiology United States statistics Hepatitis C is the major cause of chronic hepatitis in the United States. HCV infections account for 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis and for more than 40% of all referrals to active liver clinics. Alter et al reported that HCV infections account for approximately 30,000 new infections and 8000-10,000 deaths each year in the United States. [ 10]  Of new infections, 60% occur in intravenous drug users; less than 20% of new cases are acquired through sexual exposure; and 10% are due to other causes, including occupational or perinatal exposure and hemodialysis. The overall prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in the United States is 1.8% of the population. Approximately 74% of these individuals are positive for HCV RNA, meaning that active viral replication continues to occur. Thus, an estimated 3.9 million persons are infected with HCV and 2.7 million persons in the United States have chronic infection. [ 10]  Genotype 1a occurs in 57% of patients; genotype 1b occurs in 17%. From 1989-1993, the occurrence of HCV to approximately 28,000 new cases per year, reflecting an 80% decrease. Decreased transfusion-associated disease and a dramatic decrease in intravenous drug use accounted for this change. El-Serag et al reported that HCV is largely responsible for the increase in the incidence of HCC in the United States during the final decades of the 20th century. [ 11]  In the United States, the number of deaths due to HCV-related complications increased from fewer than 10,000 in 1992 to just fewer than 15,000 in 1999. According to Kim, this number is expected to increase in the future because of the current large pool of undiagnosed patients with chronic infection. [ 12]  International statistics Worldwide, more than 170 million persons have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. [ 13]  The prevalence rates in healthy blood donors are 0.01-0.02% in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, 1-1.5% in southern Europe, and 6.5% in parts of equatorial Africa. Prevalence rates as high as 22% are reported in Egypt and are attributed to the use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy. Race-, sex-, and age-related differences in incidence In the United States, HCV infection is more common among minority populations, such as black and Hispanic persons, than other populations, in association with lower economic status and educational levels. In addition, in the United States, genotype 1 is more prevalent in blacks than in other racial groups. No sex preponderance occurs with HCV infection. In the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, neither sex nor racial-ethnic group was independently associated with HCV infection. [ 10]  In the United States, 65% of persons with HCV infection are aged 30-49 years. Those who acquire the infection at a younger age have a somewhat better prognosis than those who are infected later in life. Infection is uncommon in persons aged 20 years and younger and is more prevalent in persons older than 40 years. [ 14,  15]  Data suggest an association between age and transmission route, such as nonsterile medical procedures, including vaccination and parenteral drug treatment. [ 16]  Prognosis Infection with HCV is self-limited in only a small minority of infected persons. Chronic infection develops in 70-80% of patients infected with HCV. [ 6]  Cirrhosis develops within 20 years of disease onset in 20% of persons with chronic infection. [ 17]  The onset of chronic hepatitis C infection early in life often leads to less serious consequences. [ 18,  19]  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection, iron overload, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency may promote the progression of chronic HCV infection to HCV-related cirrhosis. [ 20,  21]  Two studies of compensated cirrhosis in the United States and Europe showed that decompensation occurred in 20% of patients and that HCC occurred in approximately 10% of patients. [ 22,  23]  The survival rate at 5 and 10 years was 89% and 79%, respectively. HCC develops in 1-4% of patients with cirrhosis each year after an average of 30 years. The risk of cirrhosis and HCC doubles in patients who acquired HCV infection via transfusion. [ 24]  Progression to HCC is more common in the presence of cirrhosis, alcoholism, and HBV coinfection. Bellentani et al [ 25]  and Hourigan et al [ 26]  reported that the rate and likelihood of progression is influenced by alcohol use, immunosuppression, sex, iron status, concomitant hepatitis, and age of acquisition (see the image below). Natural history of hepatitis C virus infection.  Natural history of hepatitis C virus infection.  In an observational study of Veterans Affairs (VA) HCV clinical registry data from 128,769 patients, McCombs et al found that those who achieved an undetectable HCV viral load had a decreased risk of subsequent liver morbidity and death. [ 27,  28]  Viral load suppression reduced the risk for future liver events by 27% (eg, compensated/decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver-related hospitalization), as well as reduced the risk of death by 45%, relative to patients who did not achieve viral load suppression. [ 27,  28]  Additionally, patient race/ethnicity and HCV genotypes affected the risk of future liver events and death. The risk for all liver events and death was higher in white patients relative to black patients, and those with HCV genotype 3 had a higher risk for all study outcomes compared with patients who had HCV genotype 2 (lowest risk) or 1. [ 27,  28]  Patient Education Patients with hepatitis C should be advised to abstain from alcohol use. Optimally, patients should use barrier protection during sexual intercourse. [ 29]  Patients with hepatitis C should not donate blood or organs. One exception is in patients with HCV who require liver transplantation. Arenas et al showed that liver transplant recipients who received liver grafts from HCV-positive donors had 5-year survival rates comparable to recipients who received grafts from HCV-negative donors. [ 30]  Given the shortage of organs and the long waiting list, this strategy has proven safe and effective. In August 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expanded their existing, risk-based testing guidelines to recommend a 1-time blood test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in baby boomers—the generation born between 1945 and 1965, who account for approximately three fourths of all chronic HCV infections in the United States—without prior ascertainment of HCV risk (see  Recommendations for the Identification of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection Among Persons Born During 1945–1965 ). [ 31]  One-time HCV testing in this population could identify nearly 808,600 additional people with chronic infection. All individuals identified with HCV should be screened and/or managed for alcohol abuse, followed by referral to preventative and/or treatment services, as appropriate. Clinical Presentation History Acute hepatitis C (HCV) infection becomes chronic in 70% of patients, which represents a high rate of chronicity for a viral infection. Most patients with chronic hepatitis C infection are asymptomatic or may have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue or malaise in the absence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis from HCV infection frequently have symptoms typically observed in other patients with decompensated liver disease, such as sleep inversion and pruritus. Symptoms characteristic of complications from advanced or decompensated liver disease are related to synthetic dysfunction and  portal hypertension . These include mental status changes ( hepatic encephalopathy ), ankle edema and abdominal distention ( ascites ), and hematemesis or melena ( variceal bleeding ). Symptoms often first develop as clinical findings of extrahepatic manifestations of HCV and most commonly involve the joints, muscle, and skin. In a large study of the extrahepatic manifestations of HCV, 74% of medical workers with HCV infection demonstrated extrahepatic manifestations. [ 32]  The most commonly occurring extrahepatic manifestations were as follows: Arthralgias (23%) Paresthesias (17%) Myalgias (15%) Pruritus (15%) Sicca syndrome (11%) In addition, sensory neuropathy has been reported as an extrahepatic manifestation in 9% of patients with HCV infection. [ 33]  Risk factors for manifestations of extrahepatic chronic hepatitis C infection include advanced age, female sex, and liver fibrosis. Patients also present with symptoms that are less specific and are often unaccompanied by discrete dermatologic findings. Pruritus and urticaria are examples of less specific clues to underlying HCV infection in the appropriate setting (eg, posttransfusion, organ transplantation, surgery, intravenous drug use, injury of the nasal mucosa from snorting cocaine through shared straws). Patients with ongoing pathology associated with chronic hepatitis C that eventually results in organ failure can present with symptoms and signs in the skin. Pruritus, dryness, palmar erythema, and yellowing of the eyes and skin are examples of less specific findings in patients with end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis; these findings provide clues that lead to further evaluation of the underlying causes. Patients with the mucosa-associated lymphoma tumors (MALT) syndrome itself tend to have bowel symptoms. Chronic hepatitis C has a strong association with pruritus. Indeed, some authorities believe that all patients with unexplained pruritus should be investigated for HCV infection. [ 34]  Physical Examination Most patients with HCV infection do not have abnormal physical examination findings until they develop portal hypertension or decompensated liver disease. One exception is patients with extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection, such as  porphyria cutanea tarda  or necrotizing vasculitis. Signs in patients with decompensated liver disease include the following: Hand signs - Palmar erythema,  Dupuytren contracture , asterixis, leukonychia, clubbing Head signs - Icteric sclera, temporal muscle wasting, enlarged parotid, cyanosis Fetor hepaticus Gynecomastia, small testes Abdominal signs - Paraumbilical hernia - ascites, caput medusae, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal bruit Ankle edema Scant body hair Skin signs - Spider nevi, petechiae, excoriations due to pruritus Other common extrahepatic manifestations include the following: Cryoglobulinemia: Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Lichen planus [ 1]  (see the images below) Lichen planus.

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca Raynaud syndrome Sjogren syndrome Porphyria cutanea tarda Necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Approximately 10-15% of affected patients have symptoms such as weakness, arthralgias, and purpura; these are often related to vasculitis. The precise pathogenesis of these extrahepatic complications has not been determined, although most are the clinical expression of autoimmune phenomena. Workup Approach Considerations Serologic screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) involves an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). These assays are 97% specific but cannot distinguish acute from chronic infection. A rapid antibody test for HCV is available. The recombinant immunoblot assay is used to confirm HCV infection. A meta-analysis comparing point-of-care screening tests (POCTs) with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) indicated that POCTs are highly accurate for diagnosing hepatitis C. [ 35,  36]  POCTs do not require special equipment or electricity and are more robust than RDTs at high temperatures; thus, they may enable expanded screening. Health care personnel who sustain a needle-stick injury involving an HCV-infected patient should undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for HCV immediately and then every 2 months for 6 months. If HCV infection is diagnosed, therapy can be instituted. Other baseline studies include the following: Complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential Liver function tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level Thyroid function studies HCV genotyping as an aid for guiding treatment Quantitative HCV RNA assay Screening tests for coinfection with  HIV  or  hepatitis B virus (HBV) Screening for alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and/or depression The CBC demonstrates thrombocytopenia in approximately 10% of patients. Low thyroxine levels are found in approximately 10% of patients, as well. Stress testing may be necessary in appropriate patients. An ophthalmologic examination may also be necessary. A diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of hepatitis C is shown in the following image. Diagnostic algorithm for hepatitis C virus infection.  Diagnostic algorithm for hepatitis C virus infection.  In August 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expanded their existing, risk-based testing guidelines to recommend a 1-time blood test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in baby boomers—the generation born between 1945 and 1965, who account for approximately three fourths of all chronic HCV infections in the United States—without prior ascertainment of HCV risk (see  Recommendations for the Identification of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection Among Persons Born During 1945–1965 ). [ 31]  One-time HCV testing in this population could identify nearly 808,600 additional people with chronic infection. All individuals identified with HCV should be screened and/or managed for alcohol abuse, followed by referral to preventive and/or treatment services, as appropriate. [ 31]  In June 2013, The US Preventive Services Task Force also updated its 2004 HCV screening and treatment recommendations, advocating a 1-time screening for all persons born between 1945 and 1965. The new recommendation arose from the fact that a lack of universal blood screening for the virus prior to 1992 placed persons born between the mid-1940s and mid-1960s at increased risk of exposure to HCV. [ 37,  38,  39]  Screening for HCV in the emergency department (ED) has been found to be feasible, albeit costly. [ 40,  41]  Hepatitis C Antibody Test Anti-HCV EIAs include second- and third-generation EIAs. These assays are 97% specific but cannot distinguish acute from chronic infection. The most recent third-generation EIA detects antibodies against core protein and nonstructural proteins 3, 4, and 5 and can yield positive results an average of 8 weeks after the onset of infection. False-negative results for the presence of HCV antibody can occur in persons with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV type 1 infection, renal failure, or HCV-associated essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. False-positive EIA results can occur; the likelihood of a false-positive result is greater in persons without risk factors and in those without signs of liver disease, such as blood donors or health care workers. The FDA has approved OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test, which can be used for persons at risk for hepatitis or for those with signs or symptoms of hepatitis. The test strip can be used with a sample collected from a fingerstick or venipuncture whole blood. [ 42]  Recombinant Immunoblot Assay The recombinant immunoblot assay is used to confirm HCV infection. A positive immunoblot assay result is defined as the detection of antibodies against 2 or more antigens and an indeterminate assay result defined as the detection of antibodies against a single antigen. A positive immunoblot assay result followed by 2 or more instances of undetectable HCV RNA suggests HCV infection has resolved. A positive anti-HCV immunoassay result followed by a negative immunoblot assay result represents a false-positive immunoassay, and no further testing is required. The recombinant immunoblot assay has limited usefulness in clinical practice. Qualitative and Quantitative Assays for HCV RNA Qualitative assays can be used to test for HCV RNA. HCV RNA can be detected in blood using amplification techniques such as PCR or transcription-mediated amplification (TMA). The FDA has approved the following 2 PCR-based tests for qualitative HCV RNA detection: Cobas Amplicor Hepatitis C Virus Test, version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems): PCR with a lower limit of detection of 50 IU/mL Versant HCV RNA Qualitative Assay (Bayer HealthCare): TMA with a lower limit of detection of 9.6 IU/mL Quantitative assays ascertain HCV RNA quantity in blood, using signal amplification (branched DNA [bDNA] assay) or target amplification techniques (PCR, TMA). Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is more sensitive than bDNA testing. The HCV RNA level in blood helps predict the likelihood of a response to treatment, and the change in HCV RNA level can also be used to monitor response. The same quantitative test should be used throughout therapy to avoid confusion, and results should be reported in international units (IU) to standardize data. The only FDA-approved quantitative test is Versant HCV RNA, version 3.0 (Bayer HealthCare). It is based on bDNA technology and has a dynamic range of 615-7,700,000 IU/mL. HCV Genotyping Genotyping is helpful for predicting the likelihood of response and duration of treatment. Patients with genotypes 1 and 4 are generally treated longer than genotypes. Genotyping can be performed by direct sequence analysis, reverse hybridization to genotype-specific oligonucleotide probes, or restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). In June 2013, the FDA approved the Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II test, which, by analyzing a sample of an infected patient’s blood plasma or serum, can differentiate HCV genotypes 1, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This new test is approved for use in adult, non-immunocompromised patients with known chronic HCV infection but has not been approved for diagnostic use or as a screening test for HCV genetic material. FDA approval was based partly on a comparison of the test's accuracy with that of a validated gene-sequencing method. [ 43,  44]  Two other genotype tests are available, although neither has been approved by the FDA. They are as follows: Trugene HCV 5'NC Genotyping kit (Visible Genetics; Toronto, Canada): Based on direct sequencing followed by comparison with a reference sequence database Line Probe Assay (Inno LiPA HCVII, Innogenetics; Ghent, Belgium): Based on reverse hybridization of PCR amplicon on a nitrocellulose strip coated with genotype-specific oligonucleotide probes In addition to HCV genotype, a growing body of research indicates that patient genetics play a role in response to treatment. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860, located near the  IL28B  gene on chromosome 19, which encodes type III interferon, is associated with more than a 2-fold difference in the rate of sustained virologic response to antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This SNP can be detected by PCR and is an independent predictor of sustained virologic response regardless of HCV genotype. [ 45]  Serologic Testing Della Rossa et al reported that cryoglobulins are found in as many as 50% of persons with HCV infection. [ 46]  HCV is the primary cause of essential mixed  cryoglobulinemia  (ie, type 2 cryoglobulinemia); as many as 90% of affected persons have HCV viremia. Cryoprecipitates usually contain large amounts of HCV antigens and antibodies. Vasculitis, arterial hypertension, purpura, lichen planus, arthralgias, and low thyroxine levels were associated with titers positive for cryoglobulin. Other common serologic findings in patients with chronic HCV infection include one or more of the following: Antinuclear antibody (ANA; 41%) Rheumatoid factor (38%) Anticardiolipin antibody (27%) Antithyroid antibody (13%) Anti–smooth muscle antibody (9%) Liver Biopsy Liver biopsy  is not considered mandatory before the initiation of treatment, but it may be helpful for assessing the activity and severity of HCV-related liver disease. However, some experts recommend biopsy only in the following situations: The diagnosis is uncertain Other coinfections or disease may be present The patient being considered for treatment has normal liver enzyme levels and no extrahepatic manifestations The patient is immunocompromised Histologic Findings Lymphocytic infiltration, moderate degrees of inflammation and necrosis, and portal or bridging fibrosis are noted. Regenerative nodules are seen in patients with cirrhosis. Some patients also may have findings indicative of HCC. Most pathologists give separate measurements of disease activity (grade) and fibrosis (stage). Many scoring systems are used, including the Ishak (6-point scale) and the Knodell histologic activity index (18-point score); both are useful for assessing improvements in histologic findings in studies but are impractical for clinical use because of interobserver disagreement. The METAVIR score was developed by the French METAVIR Cooperative Study Group and reported by Bedossa and Poynard in 1996; it is frequently used in European trials. This score consists of a 3-point activity scale and 4-point fibrosis score, with good agreement among pathologists. In the United States, many pathologists use a scale described by Batts and Ludwig in 1995, which consists of an activity grade (0-4) and a fibrosis stage (0-4). Noninvasive methods of assessing hepatic fibrosis are in development. Current serum assays are directed at measuring breakdown products of extracellular matrix constituents (eg, glycoproteins, propeptides) and their regulatory enzymes (eg, lysyl oxidase, lysyl hydroxylase, propyl hydroxylase). Radiologic Studies A liver stiffness test (FibroScan) is available as a noninvasive method of staging liver disease in persons with chronic hepatitis C. Obesity, female sex, operator experience, and age older than 52 may give invalid results. Falsely high estimates of liver fibrosis have also been reported with acute inflammation and recent food intake. On December 17, 2014, the FDA gave marketing approval for the Hepatiq radiologic image processing system. [ 47,  48]  The software application uses quantitative analysis of nuclear medicine liver-spleen images to determine the severity of liver disease and to predict clinical outcomes. [ 48]  The developer noted that Hepatiq \"automates the Quantitative Liver Spleen Scan (QLSS) that has been proven to be an accurate predictor of clinical outcomes in the recently concluded HALT-C [ H  epatitis C  A  ntiviral  L  ong-term  T  reatment against  C  irrhosis] trial.\" [ 48]  The HALT-C trial was a multicenter, randomized controlled study that evaluated whether long-term interferon would suppress HCV, prevent progression to cirrhosis, prevent liver cancer, and reduce the need for liver transplantation. [ 49]  Treatment & Management Approach Considerations Patients with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection appear to have an excellent chance of responding to 6 months of standard therapy with interferon (IFN). Because spontaneous resolution is common, no definitive timing of therapy initiation can be recommended; however, waiting 2-4 months after the onset of illness seems reasonable. Treatment for chronic HCV is based on guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Associations for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), in collaboration with the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA). [ 50]   These guidelines are constantly being updated. For more information, see  HCV Guidance: Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C . The guidelines propose that because all patients cannot receive treatment immediately upon the approval of new agents, priority should be given to those with the most urgent need. The recommendations include the following [ 50]  : Patients with advanced fibrosis, those with compensated cirrhosis, liver transplant recipients, and those with severe extraheptic hepatitis are to be given the highest priority for treatment Based on available resources, patients at high risk for liver-related complications and severe extrahepatic hepatitis C complications should be given high priority for treatment Treatment decisions should balance the anticipated reduction in transmission versus the likelihood of reinfection in patients whose risk of HCV transmission is high and in whom HCV treatment may result in a reduction in transmission (eg, men who have high-risk sex with men, active injection drug users, incarcerated persons, and those on hemodialysis) Initiating treatment earlier for patients with lower stage fibrosis may extend the benefits of sustained virologic response (SVR). In a long-term follow-up study, 820 patients with Metavir stage F0 or F1 fibrosis confirmed by biopsy were followed for up to 20 years. The 15-year survival rate was statistically significantly better for those who experienced SVR compared with those whose treatment had failed or for those who remained untreated (93%, 82%, and 88%, respectively;  P  =.003). [ 51]  Treatment of chronic HCV infection has 2 goals. The first is to achieve sustained eradication of HCV (ie, SVR), which is defined as the persistent absence of HCV RNA in serum 6 months or more after completing antiviral treatment. The second goal is to prevent progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and decompensated liver disease requiring liver transplantation. Antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C should be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, treatment is widely recommended for patients with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels who meet the following criteria [ 3]  : Age greater than 18 years Positive HCV antibody and serum HCV RNA test results Compensated liver disease (eg, no hepatic encephalopathy or ascites) Acceptable hematologic and biochemical indices (hemoglobin at least 13 g/dL for men and 12 g/dL for women; neutrophil count >1500/mm 3 , serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL) Willingness to be treated and to adhere to treatment requirements No contraindications for treatment A further criterion is liver biopsy findings consistent with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis. However, a pretreatment liver biopsy is not mandatory. It may be helpful in certain situations, such as in patients with normal transaminase levels, particularly those with a history of alcohol dependence, in whom little correlation may exist between liver enzyme levels and histologic findings. Patients with normal liver enzyme levels and minimal histologic damage noted on liver biopsy may elect to defer treatment until more effective and less toxic medications become available, whereas patients with more advanced liver injury may prefer to initiate treatment sooner. Patients should be informed that the treatment of HCV infection in the setting of normal liver enzyme levels remains controversial. Viral load suppression reduces risk of hepatitis C liver morbidity and mortality. In an observational study of Veterans Affairs (VA) HCV clinical registry data from 128,769 patients that spanned more than a decade, researchers found that those who achieved an undetectable HCV viral load had a decreased risk of subsequent liver morbidity and death. [ 52,  53]  Viral load suppression reduced the risk for future liver events by 27% (eg, compensated/decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver-related hospitalization) as well as reduced the risk of death by 45%, relative to patients who did not achieve viral load suppression. Among the entire study population, only 24% had been treated previously for HCV; of these patients, only 16% (4% of all patients) achieved an undetectable viral load. [ 52,  53]  Patient race/ethnicity and HCV genotypes also affected the risk of future liver events and death. The risk for all liver events and death was higher in white patients relative to black patients, and those with HCV genotype 3 had a higher risk for all study outcomes compared with patients who had HCV genotype 2 (lowest risk) or 1. [ 52,  53]  The treatment of hepatitis C has evolved over the years. Initial studies used IFN monotherapy. Subsequently, combination of ribavirin and IFN or of IFN to which polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules have been added (ie, PEG-IFN) were used. Protease inhibitors have emerged as a third feature of combination therapy. The first protease inhibitor indicated for use in HCV infection, boceprevir (Victrelis), was approved by the FDA in May 2011 followed by approval of telaprevir. However these two protease inhibitors are not recommended due to the more recent availability of more effective options. A third protease inhibitor, simeprevir (Olysio), was approved in November 2013 and is recommended as a part of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection. More recently, HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) was shown to result in suppression of HCV replication and has emerged as an important component of currently recommended regimens. In November 2014, the FDA approved an all oral regimen of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients. [ 54]  The treatment duration is 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis and 24 weeks for those with cirrhosis. On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved the combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (Viekira Pak  )  for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection in adults, including patients with compensated cirrhosis. [ 55]  This all-oral regimen can be used with or without ribavirin. In the Viekira Pak, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir are combined as a fixed-dose tablet and the dasabuvir is a separate tablet. Ombitasvir is a NS5A inhibitor, paritaprevir is an inhibitor of the NS3/4A serine protease, and dasabuvir is a nonnucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes and is used as a pharmacologic booster for paritaprevir. Ritonavir does not have activity against HCV but significantly increases serum concentrations of paritaprevir. The recommended dosing regimen is the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed-dose combination 2 tablets once daily plus dasabuvir 1 tablet twice daily. [ 55]  Interferons and Pegylated Interferons The 2 most frequently used recombinant IFN preparations in clinical trials have been IFN alfa-2b (Intron-A) and IFN alfa-2a (Roferon-A), which differ from each other by only a single amino acid residue. IFN alfacon-1 (Infergen), or consensus IFN, is a genetically engineered compound synthesized by combining the most common amino acid sequences from all 12 naturally occurring IFNs. Roferon-A was discontinued from the market in 2007 and Infergen was discontinued from the market in 2013. The addition of propylene glycol (PEG) molecules to IFN has led to the development of long-lasting IFNs that have better sustained absorption, a slower rate of clearance, and a longer half-life than unmodified IFN, which permits more convenient once-weekly dosing. The FDA has approved PEG-IFNs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Two PEG-IFN preparations are available. PEG-IFN alfa-2b (PEG-Intron) consists of IFN alfa-2b attached to a single 12-kd PEG chain; it is excreted by the kidneys. PEG-IFN alfa-2a (Pegasys) consists of IFN alfa-2a attached to a 40-kd branched PEG molecule; it is metabolized predominantly by the liver. IFN monotherapy in acute hepatitis C Although the short courses of standard IFN monotherapy introduced in the 1980s by Hoofnagle et al, [ 56]  Davis et al, [ 4]  and Di Bisceglie et al [ 57]  led to sustained improvement in liver disease and loss of virus in less than 10% of patients, these therapies were the first to cure chronic viral hepatitis. IFN monotherapy may play a role in the treatment of acute HCV infection. Jaeckel et al reported that treatment with IFN alfa-2b prevented chronic infection in 98% of a group of 44 German patients with acute hepatitis C. [ 58]  In this study, patients received 5 million U/day of IFN alfa-2b subcutaneously for 4 weeks and then 3 times per week for another 20 weeks; the IFN alfa-2b was well tolerated in all patients but one. [ 58]  Because spontaneous resolution is common, no definitive timing of therapy can be recommended; however, waiting 2-4 months after the onset of illness seems reasonable. PEG-IFN monotherapy Several reports have documented improved SVR with PEG-IFN monotherapy. In a randomized study of patients with chronic hepatitis C, Zeuzem et al found that PEG-IFN alfa-2a at 180 mcg subcutaneously administered once per week was associated with a higher rate of virologic response than IFN alfa-2a at 6 million U subcutaneously administered 3 times per week for 12 weeks followed by 3 million U 3 times per week for 36 weeks. [ 59]  Findings were 69% versus 28% at week 48 of therapy and 39% versus 19% at week 72 of therapy. [ 59]  In a controlled trial of persons with cirrhosis, Heathcote and colleagues reported an SVR rate of 30% after 48 weeks of therapy with PEG-IFN alfa-2a, compared with 8% for patients treated with standard IFN alfa. Adverse effects were not significantly higher with the pegylated product. [ 60]  Interferons and Ribavirin A major advance in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C was the addition of the oral nucleoside analogue ribavirin to the IFN regimen. As reported in the landmark 1998 studies by McHutchison et al [ 61]  and Poynard et al, [ 62]  IFN alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy for 6-12 months resulted in sustained eradication rates of 30-40%. However, patients with HCV genotype 1 who were treated for 12 months had a much less favorable response than patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3 who received a 6-month course of therapy. PEG-IFN therapy with ribavirin As with IFN alfa, the addition of ribavirin to PEG-IFN heralded a new era in the treatment of chronic HCV. The benefits of combination therapy were documented in 3 landmark trials: Manns et al from 2001, [ 63]  Fried et al from 2002, [ 64]  and Hadziyannis et al from 2004. [ 65]  Manns et al reported a significantly higher SVR rate in patients given higher-dose PEG-IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin than in patients given lower-dose PEG-IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin or given IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin. [ 63]  Adverse-effect profiles in the 3 treatment groups were similar. Secondary analyses identified body weight and HCV RNA viral load less than 1 million copies per milliliter as important predictors of SVR. (See the image below.) Pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C.  Pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C.  Fried at al found that patients who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin had a significantly higher SVR rate than patients who received IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin (56% vs 44%) or PEG-IFN alfa-2a alone (56% vs 29%). [ 64]  The SVR rates for patients with HCV genotype 1 were 46%, 36%, and 21%, respectively, for the 3 regimens. Hadziyannis et al reported that in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 48 weeks of treatment was statistically superior to 24 weeks, and standard-dose ribavirin was statistically superior to low-dose ribavirin. [ 65]  In this study, 1311 persons were randomized to PEG-IFN alfa-2a at 180 mcg/wk for 24 or 48 weeks plus a low dose (800 mg/day) or standard weight-based dose (1000 or 1200 mg/day) of ribavirin. [ 65]  In patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3, there were no statistically significant differences in SVR rates in the 4 treatment groups. In a study of ribavirin in combination with either PEG-IFN alfa-2b or PEG-IFN alfa-2a for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, Ascione et al reported a higher SVR rate with PEG-IFN alfa-2a than with PEG-IFN alfa-2b (68% versus 54.4%). [ 66]  SVR rates were not statistically different in patients with a baseline HCV RNA of 500,000 IU/mL or less or in those with cirrhosis. [ 66]  In a similar trial, Rumi et al reported that treatment with ribavirin plus PEG-IFN alfa-2a resulted in a significantly higher SVR rate than ribavirin plus PEG-IFN alfa-2b. The 2 regimens showed a similar safety profile. [ 67]  In a study of patients coinfected with HCV and HIV with compensated cirrhosis, Mira et al found that SVR to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin significantly reduced the incidence of liver-related decompensations and overall mortality. [ 68]  The probability of hepatic decompensation was 0% at 1 year and 4% at 3 years for SVR patients, compared with 15% and 32%, respectively, for non-SVR patients. The probability of overall mortality was 0% at 1 year and 4% at 3 years for SVR patients, compared with 12% and 20%, respectively, for non-SVR patients. In conclusion, treatment with PEG-IFN alfa-2a and ribavirin may be individualized by genotype. Patients with HCV genotype 1 require treatment for 48 weeks and a standard dose of ribavirin; those with HCV genotype 2 or 3 seem to be adequately treated with a low dose of ribavirin for 24 weeks. [ 69]  Response to therapy of HCV genotype 1 (ie, achievement of SVR) can now be predicted by identifying the single neoceotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the region of interleukin ( IL )-28B gene through genome-wide association studies. Patients with CC genotype of the IL-28B have much more favorable response as compared to CT or TT genotypr (70% vs 25-30%). Testing for IL-28B genotype is thus a useful tool in the managemet of patients. [ 70]  Adverse effects Adverse effects are common with IFN and ribavirin combination therapy. Approximately 75% of patients experience one or more of adverse effects. Adverse effects of IFN include the following: Hematologic complications (ie, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) Neuropsychiatric complications (ie, memory and concentration disturbances, visual disturbances, headaches, depression, irritability) Flu-like symptoms Metabolic complications (ie, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, low-grade fever) Gastrointestinal complications (ie, nausea, vomiting, weight loss) Dermatologic complications (ie, alopecia) Pulmonary complications (ie, interstitial fibrosis) Adverse effects of ribavirin include the following: Hematologic complications (ie,  hemolytic anemia ) Reproductive complications (ie, birth defects) Metabolic complications (ie, gout) Because of the risk of reproductive complications from ribavirin, recommend that patients and their spouses not become pregnant while either is on therapy and for 6 months after the completion of treatment. Growth factors, such as granulocyte-stimulating factor (GSF) and erythropoietin, are frequently used to counteract the adverse hematologic effects of IFN and ribavirin, respectively. Despite the encouraging early results reported by Afdhal et al [ 71]  and Van Thiel et al, [ 72]  cost-effectiveness data supporting the routine use of these agents as a means of avoiding IFN and ribavirin dose reductions are insufficient. In November 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eltrombopag (Promacta), an oral thrombopoietin agonist, for treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of IFN-based therapy. The approval was based on results from the phase 3  E  ltrombopag to I  N  itiate and Maintain Interferon  A  ntiviral Treatment to  B  enefit Subjects with Hepatitis C related  L  iver Diseas  E  (ENABLE) 1 and 2 trials, which showed eltrombopag significantly reduced the time to the first IFN dose reduction compared with placebo. [ 73,  74]  Because of this, a significant improvement in virologic response was observed in the eltrombopag group compared with placebo. These randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies collectively enrolled 1521 patients with platelet counts less than 75,000/mcL. ENABLE 1 utilized PEG-IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin for antiviral treatment and ENABLE 2 utilized PEG-IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin. In patients who are at risk of depression or who develop depression during treatment, any antidepressant is better than none. Because available evidence suggests that all antidepressants will have an effect, Schaefer et al reported that treatment must be individualized on the basis of adverse effect profile, drug-to-drug interactions, and general considerations (eg, speed of onset, efficacy). [ 75]  Fatigue is common in patients with chronic hepatitis C but is poorly associated with biochemical parameters. Sustained response is accompanied by substantial improvement of fatigue. [ 76]  Protease and Polymerase Inhibitors Protease inhibitors A new class of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) targets specific enzymes involved in viral replication. The addition of these new protease inhibitors to pegylated interferon and ribavirin further improves the treatment responses. Boceprevir (Victrelis) and telaprevir (Incivek) are HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors and were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2011. However, treatment with either of these agents is no longer recommended because of higher efficacy with regimens that contain sofosbuvir or simeprevir. In August 2014, Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced they will discontinue the sale and distribution of telaprevir in the United States by October 2014. A third HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor, simeprevir (Olysio), was approved in November 2013. Each of these is indicated for treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in combination with PEG-IFN alfa and ribavirin in adults with compensated liver disease, including cirrhosis, who are previously untreated or who have failed previous interferon and ribavirin therapy. In November 2014, the FDA approved an all-oral regimen of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients; the duration of treatment is 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis and 24 weeks for those with cirrhosis. [ 54]  The approval for simeprevir plus sofosbuvir was based on the COSMOS study, an open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial. [ 54]  For all patients (treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced, with or without cirrhosis), 93% achieved a sustained virologic response at treatment week 12 (SVR12) after 12 weeks of treatment, and 97% achieved SVR12 after 24 weeks of treatment. [ 54]  The QUEST 1 and QUEST 2 phase 3 trials assessed efficacy of simeprevir in 785 adult, treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1. Results showed that 80% and 81% of patients treated with simeprevir (plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) achieved SVR12 compared with the peginterferon alfa and ribavirin control groups (50%). [ 77]  In the PROMISE study, 393 patients who had previous relapse after completing HCV treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, were randomized to receive either 150 mg of once-daily simeprevir for 12 weeks plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks based on response guided treatment criteria (simeprevir group) or pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone for 48 weeks (control group). In this study, the SVR12 was 79% in the simeprevir treatment group compared with 37% with peginterferon and ribavirin alone. [ 77]  The presence of the Q80K HCV GT1a polymorphism (commonly found in GT1a patients in the United States) at baseline had a substantial impact on the efficacy of simeprevir. In the pooled trials, the differences in SVR12 rates in GT1a patients with the Q80K polymorphism were not statistically significant between the treatment (58%) and control (55%) groups. In HPC3007, the SVR12 rates for those with the Q80K polymorphism were 47% in the treatment group and 30% in the control group. Simeprevir was approved by the FDA for the treatment of HCV genotype 4 monoinfected and HCV/HIV coinfected patients as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen that includes peginterferon and ribavirin. The open-label, single-arm study (RESTORE) included 107 patients with HCV GT4 infection. Treatment included simeprevir 150 mg once daily plus peginterferon and ribavirin for 12 weeks, followed by peginterferon and ribavirin alone (12 or 36 weeks, response guided). Overall, 65.4% of patients achieved SVR12 (82.9% treatment naïve; 86.4% prior relapsers; 60% prior partial responders; 40% prior null responders). In treatment-naïve and prior relapser patients fulfilling response-guided criteria for 24 weeks of treatment (88.6% and 90.9%), SVR12 rates were high: 93.5% and 95.0%, respectively. These results were similar to previous reports for HCV GT1. [ 78]  Newer approaches to hepatitis C therapy involve treatment with 2 direct-acting antiviral agents. In a preliminary study a combination of NS5A replication complex inhibitor daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and the NS3 protease inhibitor asunaprevir (600 mg twice daily) resulted in a sustained virologic response in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who had not responded to prior therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin. [ 79]  Polymerase inhibitors HCV NS5B polymerase plays an essential role in HCV replication. Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) is a NS5B polymerase inhibitor that results in suppression of HCV replication and life cycle. Sofosbuvir was approved by the FDA in December 2013 for treatment of CHC infection genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as part of a combination antiviral regimen, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) to prevent HCV recurrence and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. Sofosbuvir treatment regimens and duration are dependent on both viral genotype and patient population. Patients with genotype 1 or 4 are treated with sofosbuvir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 12 weeks. Those with genotype 2 or 3 are part of an all oral drug regimen consisting of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks respectively. Approval for sofosbuvir was supported by data from several Phase 3 studies that evaluated 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with the drug combined with either ribavirin or ribavirin plus peginterferon alfa. Three of these studies evaluated sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in genotype 2 or 3 patients who were either treatment-naïve, [ 80]  treatment-experienced [ 81]  or peginterferon intolerant, ineligible or unwilling. [ 81]  The fourth study evaluated sofosbuvir in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients with genotypes 1, 4, 5 or 6. [ 80]  In these studies, sofosbuvir-based therapy was found to be superior to historical controls [ 80]  or to placebo, [ 81]  or noninferior to currently available treatment options [ 80]  based on the proportion of patients who had a SVR12  after completing therapy. Patients who achieve SVR12 are considered cured of HCV. Trial participants taking sofosbuvir-based therapy achieved SVR12 rates of 50-90%. During the FDA’s review, data from two additional Phase 3 studies were added to the NDA as a result of the Breakthrough Designation status. In the first study, patients with genotype 3 HCV infection were treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 24 weeks. Eighty-four percent of patients in this trial achieved SVR12. [ 82]  The second study evaluated sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks in patients with genotype 2 HCV infection co-infected with HIV-1. [ 83]  In all Phase 3 studies, no viral resistance to sofosbuvir was detected among patients who relapsed following completion of therapy. Harvoni is a combination oral product containing ledipasvir, an NS5A protein inhibitor, and sofosbuvir that was approved by the FDA in October 2014 for HCV genotype 1. Since its original approval in the United States, the indication has been expanded to include genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6.  It is administered once daily and does not need to be administered with interferon. Some regimens may require ribavirin. Studies showed a high, sustained virologic response (94-99%) in all treatment groups (ie, treatment naïve or treatment experienced, with or without cirrhosis, and liver transplant recipients). [ 84,  85,  86]  This fixed-dose combination drug demonstrated efficacy in refractory cirrhotic hepatitis C. In a study of 154 patients with cirrhotic chronic HCV infection who had failed previous protease inhibitor–based therapy, treatment with the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) with or without ribavirin led to sustained viral response in the majority of patients. [ 87,  88]  Study subjects received either ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plus placebo for 24 weeks or placebo for 12 weeks followed by ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Sustained viral response 12 weeks after treatment was seen in 96% of the 24-week combination group and 97% of the 12-week combination plus ribavirin group. Three patients in the 12-week group and two patients in the 24-week group experienced relapses. [ 87,  88]  Combination products The fixed-dose HCV NS5A and NS3/4A protease inhibitor, elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier) was approved in January 2016 for use with or without ribavirin for adults with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 infection. Elbasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion assembly. Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease, which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV-encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. Efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir was evaluated in clinical trials that included nearly 1,400 patients. The overall SVR rates ranged from 94% to 97% for genotype 1 and 97% to 100% for genotype 4 across trials. [ 89,  90]  The approved dosage regimens are specific to the characteristics of the patient and their virus genotype. Prior to initiating therapy, patients should be tested for NS5A resistance in HCV genotype 1a–infected patients to determine the dosage regimen and duration. On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved the combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (Viekira Pak) for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection in adults, including patients with compensated cirrhosis. Studies were conducted using 2 tablets of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets once daily (in the morning) plus 1 tablet of dasabuvir 250 mg tablet twice daily (morning and evening) with a meal with ribavirin (up to 6 pills divided into 2 daily doses) for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks (compensated cirrhosis) with the cure rates summarized below. [ 91,  92,  93,  94,  95]  HCV genotype 1a infection cure rates for the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir combination included the following: No cirrhosis - SVR12 rates were 95% for 12 weeks of treatment with ribavirin (SAPPHIRE-I Study); SVR12 was 97% for 12 weeks of treatment with ribavirin but 90% without ribavirin (PEARL-IV Study) Cirrhosis - SVR12 rates were 89% in the 12-week arm and 95% in the 24-week arm; prior treatment null responders had lower SVR rates (TURQOUISE-II Study) HCV genotype 1b infection cure rates for the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir combination included the following: No cirrhosis - SVR12 rates were 99% for 12 weeks of treatment with ribavirin (PEARL-III Study) Cirrhosis: SVR12 rates were 98.5% in the 12-week arm (with ribavirin) and 100 percent in the 24-week arm; prior treatment null responders had lower SVR rates (TURQOUISE-II Study) The combination product ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Technivie) was FDA approved in July 2015 for treatment of genotype 4 chronic HCV without cirrhosis. [ 96]  It is recommended to be used in conjunction with ribavirin. Treatment Recommendations for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection The following recommendations are based on  guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD], the Infectious Disease Society of America [ISDA], and the International Antiviral Society-USA [IAS-USA]. [ 50]  They are available at  http://www.hcvguidelines.org/full-report-view . Treatment-naïve patients HCV genotype 1a infection In general, there are three options with similar efficacy recommended for treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1a infection, as follows: Daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg)/sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks Daily fixed-dose combination of paritaprevir (150 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg)/ombitasvir (25 mg)  plus  twice-daily dasabuvir (250 mg)  and  weight-based ribavirin (RBV) (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]) for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks (cirrhosis) Daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  plus  simeprevir (150 mg), with or without weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]), for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks (cirrhosis without Q80 polymorphism) Daily daclatasvir (60 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg), for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks with or without ribavirin (cirrhosis) HCV genotype 1b infection There are generally three options with similar efficacy recommended for treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1b infection, as follows: Daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg)/sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks Daily fixed-dose combination of paritaprevir (150 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg)/ombitasvir (25 mg)  plus  twice-daily dasabuvir (250 mg) for 12 weeks. The addition of weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]) is recommended in patients with cirrhosis. Daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  plus  simeprevir (150 mg) for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks with or without weight-based RBV (cirrhosis) Daily daclatasvir (60 mg) plus sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks, with or without weight-based ribavirin, (cirrhosis) for treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1b infection HCV genotype 2 infection The recommended regimen is daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  and  weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]) for 12 weeks (16 weeks in patients with cirrhosis); this regimen may be extended up to 16 weeks for treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis Daily daclatasvir (60 mg) plus sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks, in patients who cannot tolerate ribavirin HCV genotype 3 infection Daclatasvir (Daklinza), an NS5A inhibitor, was FDA approved in July 2015 for use with sofosbuvir for chronic HCV genotype 3 infection. [ 97]  The dose is 60 mg PO once daily  plus  sofosbuvir 400 mg once daily. In the ALLY-3 study, SVR at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 98% of treatment-naïve patients and 92% of treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis. [ 98]   Patients with cirrhosis had reduced SVR, 58% and 69%, respectively, in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. Daily sofosbuvir 400 mg PO once per day  plus  daily ribavirin for 12 weeks  plus  weekly pegylated interferon for 24 weeks  ( NOTE:  This regimen, described in the phase III VALENCE trial, may be utilized in both treatment-naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients [ 82]  ; the SVR rate was 93% in treatment-naïve patients and 77% in treatment-experienced patients) Daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  plus  weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks who are IFN-ineligible Daily daclatasvir (60 mg) plus sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24 weeks, with or without weight-based RBV (cirrhosis) HCV genotype 4 infection Several options with similar efficacy are recommended for treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 4 infection, as follows: Daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg)/sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks Daily fixed-dose combination of paritaprevir (150 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg)/ombitasvir (25 mg)  and  weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]) for 12 weeks Daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  and  weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]) for 24 weeks Alternative regimens include the following: Daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  and  weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg])  plus  weekly PEG-IFN for 12 weeks Daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)  plus  simeprevir (150 mg), with or without weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg]), for 12 weeks The combination product ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Technivie) was FDA approved in July 2015. [ 96]  It is indicated for treatment of genotype 4 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis in patients who were either treatment naïve or did not achieve a virologic response with prior treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV). It is recommended to be used in combination with ribavirin, although it may be considered for treatment-naïve patients who cannot take or tolerate ribavirin. [ 96]  In the PEARL-1 study, all patients who received Technivie with ribavirin achieved SVR12 compared with 91% of those who received Technivie without ribavirin. [ 99]  Clinical trials did not include patients who were previously treated with direct-acting antivirals.

[ 96]  It is indicated for treatment of genotype 4 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis in patients who were either treatment naïve or did not achieve a virologic response with prior treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV). It is recommended to be used in combination with ribavirin, although it may be considered for treatment-naïve patients who cannot take or tolerate ribavirin. [ 96]  In the PEARL-1 study, all patients who received Technivie with ribavirin achieved SVR12 compared with 91% of those who received Technivie without ribavirin. [ 99]  Clinical trials did not include patients who were previously treated with direct-acting antivirals. Patients with HCV genotypes 5 or 6 infection in whom prior treatment has failed The recommended regimen is daily fixed-dose combination ledipasvir (90 mg)/sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 weeks An alternative regimen for IFN eligible patients with HCV genotypes 5 or 6 infection in whom prior treatment has failed is the following: IFN eligible: The recommended regimen is daily sofosbuvir (400 mg) and weight-based RBV (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 1200 mg [≥75 kg])  plus  weekly PEG-IFN for 12 weeks HIV-HCV Coinfection HIV/HCV-coinfected persons should be treated and retreated the same as persons without HIV infection. Antiretroviral treatment interruption to allow HCV therapy is NOT recommended. However, several important points related to drug interactions with antiretroviral medications need to be emphasized, as follows: Fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg)/sofosbuvir (400 mg): Because ledipasvir increases tenofovir levels, concomitant use of these agents mandates consideration of the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate; avoid their use in those with CrCl below 60 mL/min. Because potentiation of this effect is expected when tenofovir is used with ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors, avoid using ledipasvir with this combination unless the antiretroviral regimen cannot be changed and the urgency of treatment is high. For combination agents expected to increase tenofovir levels, baseline and ongoing assessment for tenofovir nephrotoxicity is recommended. Paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir should be used with antiretroviral drugs with which they do not have substantial interactions, such as raltegravir (and probably dolutegravir), enfuvirtide, tenofovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and atazanavir. The dose of ritonavir used for boosting of HIV protease inhibitors may need to be adjusted (or held) when administered with paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir; restore the dose when the HCV treatment is completed. The HIV protease inhibitor should be administered at the same time as the fixed-dose HCV combination. Simeprevir should only be used with antiretroviral drugs with which it does not have clinically significant interactions, such as raltegravir (and probably dolutegravir), rilpivirine, maraviroc, enfuvirtide, tenofovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and abacavir. Avoid use of the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg)/sofosbuvir (400 mg) with cobicistat and elvitegravir. Avoid use of sofosbuvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with tipranavir. Avoid use of the fixed-dose combination of paritaprevir (150 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg)/ombitasvir (25 mg) plus twice-daily dosed dasabuvir (250 mg) with efavirenz, rilpivirine, darunavir, or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. Avoid use of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir, with or without dasabuvir, in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals who are not taking antiretroviral therapy. Avoid use of simeprevir with efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, cobicistat, or any HIV protease inhibitors. Avoid use of ribavirin with didanosine, stavudine, or zidovudine. Hepatitis C and B Coinfection Coinfection with HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), in the absence of HIV infection, is relatively uncommon in the United States, and optimal treatment regimens have not been established. However, 2 important studies are worth mentioning. Villa et al reported that 9 million U of standard IFN 3 times weekly for 3 months could clear HCV in 31% of patients with HCV-HBV coinfection. [ 100]  Liu et al used standard IFN and ribavirin and discovered that sustained HCV eradication was achieved at rates comparable to those in patients with HCV alone and, interestingly, up to 21% of their patients lost the hepatitis B surface antigen. [ 101]  Given the superior efficacy of PEG-IFN over standard IFN, Liu et al subsequently conducted a multicenter study using PEG-IFN and ribavirin in HVC-HBC coinfected patients. This regimen proved equally effective in patients with HCV monoinfection and in those with chronic HCV-HBV infection. [ 102]  Interferon Response in Specific Populations Several small studies have reported a lower response rate to IFN alfa in black patients with chronic hepatitis C infection than in white patients. The increased prevalence of infection with HCV genotype 1, which is associated with a lower response rate than other genotypes, has been suggested as the cause. However, in a study that enrolled equal proportions of black and non-Hispanic white patients with chronic hepatitis from HCV genotype 1, Muir et al reported that the SVR rate was significantly higher among non-Hispanic white patients (52%) than among black patients (19%) after treatment with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and ribavirin for 48 weeks. [ 103]  Multivariate analyses examining sociodemographic and clinical characteristics found that black race was the only variable significantly associated with the difference in response rates. Hepburn et al analyzed data from 661 patients in 2 multicenter trials and found that compared with white patients, Asians were more likely to respond to treatment, and Hispanics and blacks were less likely to respond. [ 104]  The role of ethnicity in predicting successful viral eradication emerged after multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for factors known to impact outcome (eg, genotype). Nonresponse or Relapse For patients who do not achieve an SVR after a full course of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin, retreatment is recommended with regimens listed above. Patients who do not respond to antiviral therapy and who have advanced fibrosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and varices and should be evaluated for  liver transplantation  if they are appropriate candidates. Patients with mild fibrosis should be monitored without treatment. [ 105]  Hayashi and Kasahara noted that exposure to IFN, irrespective of HCV eradication status, was associated with a reduced incidence of HCC. [ 106]  An important randomized study by Kubo et al, first conducted in 1996 with follow-up in 2002, also demonstrated that the administration of IFN to patients undergoing liver resection for HCC was associated with reduced tumor recurrence and improved survival. [ 107]  Although IFN may have a role in reducing the incidence of HCC, it remains unclear as to which subgroup of HCV patients are most likely to benefit. The aim of treating decompensated cirrhotic patients is to achieve sustained viral eradication before liver transplantation in an attempt to prevent recurrent HCV infection. However, this intervention is not recommended outside of clinical trials because the risks of treatment can outweigh the benefits. [ 108]  Although viral titers may decrease during treatment and possibly diminish the severity of recurrent HCV infection, complications and successful eradication are less likely in patients with more advanced liver disease. [ 109]  Recurrence after liver transplantation Recurrent HCV infection is universal after liver transplantation, can lead to cirrhosis in 30% of patients within 5 years, and is emerging as the most common cause of retransplantation in the United States. [ 110]  IFN is contraindicated after organ transplantation because of its high risk of precipitating rejection, in part due to upregulation of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system by IFN. Liver transplantation is a possible exception, however, as allograft rejection is uncommon in liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV infection who are treated with IFN-based therapies. SOF-based therapy is now recommended for patients with recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation; first-line regimens are as follows: for genotype 1, SOF plus SMV with or without RBV for 12 to 24 weeks; for genotypes 2 and 3, SOF plus RBV for 24 weeks Patients with normal liver eEnzyme levels The treatment for these patients remains controversial, because previous studies have demonstrated that they frequently have mild liver disease, do not tolerate therapy, or can develop new elevations in liver chemistry parameters after starting treatment. Liver biopsy can be valuable in these cases. Hui et al reported that ALT levels and histologic findings are not well correlated and patients can have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in the presence of normal liver enzyme levels. [ 111]  Jacobson et al reported that sustained HCV eradication rates in patients with HCV infection and normal ALT values were comparable to those in patients with elevated liver enzyme levels. [ 112]  However, the authors used both high-dose (5 million U) and low-dose (3 million U) IFN with ribavirin in their study, and only 1 patient had cirrhosis. [ 112]  In addition, Jacobson et al did not investigate the role of previous alcohol use on liver injury, although all patients abstained from alcohol for at least 12 months. Future trials will most likely evaluate PEG-IFN with ribavirin in this cohort of patients, and the hope is they will adjust for confounders, such as alcohol use. Patients Using Alcohol or Injection Drugs In 1998, Wiley et al reported that significant alcohol use (>40 g alcohol/d in women and >60 g of alcohol/day in men for >5 y) in HCV-infected patients resulted in a twofold to threefold greater risk of liver cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease. In addition, cirrhosis developed more rapidly in alcohol users. [ 113]  Because of the risk that alcohol use poses for rapid liver fibrosis, hepatoma, and deleterious effects on treatment response, complete alcohol abstinence is recommended during treatment. Practice guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend that HCV treatment not be withheld from patients who use illicit drugs or are on a methadone maintenance program, provided they are willing to maintain close monitoring, including practicing contraception. [ 114]  However, the guidelines note that \"it is important to consider the individual issues that may affect the risks and benefits of treatment of HCV infection in persons who use illicit drugs, rather than to make categorical recommendations.\" [ 105]  The complexity of HCV treatment in these patients is aided by a multidisciplinary team approach composed of physicians, nurses, and substance abuse and mental health professionals. Deterrence/Prevention Currently, no products are available to prevent HCV infection. The development of immunoprophylaxis for this disease is proving difficult; an effective neutralizing immune response has not been demonstrated. Patients with hepatitis C should be advised to abstain from alcohol use; they should also be advised to use barrier protection during sexual intercourse. Screening high-risk patients and initiating appropriate treatment may decrease the prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC. In an ongoing prospective study of prevention of HCV infection in injection-drug users, researchers recommended 6 measures that can be used to prevent the spread of hepatitis C [ 115,  116]  : Reducing risk from shared ancillary drug preparation equipment, such as containers, rinse water, and filters, in addition to shared syringes Using a new rapid test at the point of care that offers results in 20 minutes can detect infection before seroconversion occurs and, combined with counseling, can help to stem transmission Addressing social and relational contexts of injecting can encourage uninfected individuals to take precautions when injecting drugs with infected sex partners Encouraging \"taking a break\" from injecting drugs Developing models to guide delivery of new prevention strategies, including already-available approaches such as increasing syringe availability and future strategies such as direct-acting antivirals that can be used prophylactically, as well as vaccines Combining interventions in synergistic ways, such as needle exchange and methadone maintenance programs Consultations and Long-Term Monitoring Consultation with a gastroenterologist and hepatologist is recommended in the treatment of HCV infection. Consultation with a psychiatrist may be helpful before and during treatment in patients at risk of depression or other psychiatric illnesses. Consultation with a surgeon may be necessary for patients in whom hepatic resection for HCC or liver transplantation is being considered. At week 12 of treatment, the patient should be evaluated for an early virologic response by repeating the quantitative HCV RNA and IFN-associated thyroid dysfunction screening. If the HCV RNA level is undetectable or if a greater than 2-log-fold reduction in HCV RNA level is present, therapy should be continued because, according to Fried et al, up to 65% of patients go on to develop an SVR. [ 64]  Conversely, if an early virologic response is not present, treatment should be stopped, because the chance of developing a sustained response of HCV eradication is less than 3%. Poynard et al reported that the one exception is in the context of clinical trials or treatment of recurrent HCV infection in liver transplant recipients [ 117]  ; improved fibrosis scores have been reported in patients in whom the virus has not been eradicated, thus identifying a subgroup of patients who may benefit from maintenance therapy. The HCV RNA level should be rechecked 6 months after the completion of treatment; if HCV RNA is detectable, the patient has had a relapse of disease and an alternative treatment should therefore be considered. If HCV RNA is undetectable and test results remain negative, the patient has developed an SVR. Patients with HCV infection should be monitored closely for adverse effects as well as response to therapy. Tests to help monitor drug toxicity include the following: Complete blood count with differential Renal function testing Liver function tests (including alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level) Thyrotropin level While measurement of ALT levels is useful for monitoring the effectiveness of therapy for HCV infection, ALT levels can fluctuate. Consequently, a single value in the reference range does not rule out active infection, progressive liver disease, or cirrhosis. ALT normalization with therapy is not proof of cure. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for HCC and esophageal varices. They should also be monitored for the development of decompensated liver disease. Vaccination against hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HBV before or after completing HCV treatment has been recommended. [ 118]  Patients should be offered vaccination for HAV and HBV before they develop decompensated liver disease, after which they may be less likely to mount an immune response. Differential Diagnoses Autoimmune Hepatitis Cholangitis Viral Hepatitis Medication Medication Summary The addition of HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors with or without PED IFN alfa and ribavirin has become the new standard of care for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. Regimens that use these new agents significantly improve sustained virologic response rates in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and, often, they also allow shorter treatment durations. Sofosbuvir is an oral NS5B polymerase inhibitor that was FDA-approved for HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is the first oral regimen without INF and ribavirin approved by the FDA for HCV. Daclatasvir (Daklinza), an NS5A inhibitor, was FDA approved in July 2015 for use with sofosbuvir for chronic HCV genotype 3 infection in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients. [ 97]  Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (Viekira Pak) is another IFN-free combination regimen that has been FDA approved. It is indicated for treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, including patients with compensated cirrhosis. This combination regimen also may be used for patients with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir is used in combination with ribavirin in certain patient populations (ie, those with genotype 1a, with or without cirrhosis; those with genotype 1b, with cirrhosis). The combination product ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Technivie) was FDA approved in July 2015. [ 96]  It is indicated for treatment of genotype 4 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis in patients who were either treatment naïve or did not achieve a virologic response with prior treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV). It is recommended to be used in combination with ribavirin, although it may be considered for treatment-naïve patients who cannot take or tolerate ribavirin. [ 96]  HCV Protease Inhibitors Class Summary These agents interfere with HCV replication by inhibiting a key viral enzyme, NS3/4A serine protease. Simeprevir (Olysio) Simeprevir inhibits HCV NS3/4A protease needed for proteolytic cleavage of the HCV-encoded polyprotein into mature forms. It is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotypes 1 and 4 infection in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. For genotype 1a, it may be prescribed as an all-oral regimen in combination with sofosbuvir. HCV Polymerase Inhibitors Class Summary HCV NS5B polymerase plays an essential role in HCV replication. Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) Sofosbuvir is a NS5B polymerase inhibitor that results in suppression of HCV replication and interrupts HCV life cycle. It is indicated for treatment of CHC infection genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as part of a combination antiviral regimen, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) to prevent HCV recurrence and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection.  HCV NS5A Inhibitors Class Summary NS5A is integral for HCV RNA viral replication. Daclatasvir (Daklinza) Daclatasvir inhibits NS5A, a nonstructural protein encoded by HCV. It binds to the N-terminus within domain 1 of NS5A, which may cause structural distortions that interfere with NS5A functions, and thereby inhibits both viral RNA replication and virion assembly. It is indicated for use with sofosbuvir for chronic HCV genotypes 1 and 3 infection. Depending on the genotype and other variables (eg, presence of cirrhosis, post liver transplantation), the regimen may also include ribavirin. Combination Products Class Summary Several combination products have been approved and additional ones are being investigated to provide all oral regimens with high degrees of efficacy.  Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) Ledipasvir inhibits HCV NS5A protein, which is required for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5B RNA-dependent polymerase. The oral combination is indicated for treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C infection with genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6. Duration of therapy ranges from 8 to 24 weeks and depends on if the patient is treatment-naïve or experienced, and if cirrhosis is evident. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir & dasabuvir (Viekira Pak) This product is indicated for treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, including patients with compensated cirrhosis; may be used for patients with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection. It is used in combination with ribavirin in certain patient populations (ie, genotype 1a, with or without cirrhosis; genotype 1b, with cirrhosis). Ombitasvir inhibits HCV NS5A, which is required for viral replication. Paritaprevir is a NS3/4A serine protease inhibitor. NS3/4A protease is needed for proteolytic cleavage of the HCV-encoded polyprotein into mature forms. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is used as a \"boosting agent\" to increase paritaprevir serum levels. Dasabuvir is a nonnucleoside NS5B RNA-dependent polymerase inhibitor. It's inhibition, in turn, suppresses viral replication. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Technivie) Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is indicated in combination with ribavirin for genotype 4 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis. Ombitasvir inhibits HCV NS5A, which is required for viral replication. Paritaprevir is a NS3/4A serine protease inhibitor. NS3/4A protease is needed for proteolytic cleavage of the HCV-encoded polyprotein into mature forms. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is used as a \"boosting agent\" to increase paritaprevir serum levels. Elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier) Elbasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion assembly. Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease, which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV-encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. It is indicated with or without ribavirin for treatment of adults with chronic HCV genotypes 1 or 4 infection. Interferons and ribavirin Class Summary Interferons are naturally produced proteins with antiviral, antitumoral, and immunomodulatory actions. Interferons alfa, beta, and gamma may be given topically, systemically, and intralesionally. Interferons are immunomodulators that may shorten the clinical course, prevent complications, prevent latent and/or subsequent recurrences, decrease transmission, and eliminate established latency. Interferon alfa-2b (Intron-A) IFN alfa-2b is a protein product manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. The adult dosage is 3 million units subcutaneously (SC) 3 times weekly. Modulation of host immune response by IFN may play an important role in the treatment of viral diseases.  Peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG-Intron, Sylatron) PEG-IFN consists of IFN alfa-2b attached to a single 12-kd PEG chain. It is excreted by the kidneys. PEG-IFN has sustained absorption, a slower rate of clearance, and a longer half-life than unmodified IFN, which permits more convenient once-weekly dosing and significantly improves quality of life for patients. The adult dose is 1.5 mcg/kg SC.  Pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) PEG-IFN alfa-2a consists of IFN alfa-2a attached to a 40-kd branched PEG molecule. It is predominantly metabolized by the liver. The adult dosage is 180 mcg/kg SC once weekly. Ribavirin (Rebetol, Virazole, Copegus, Moderiba, Ribasphere) Ribavirin is an antiviral nucleoside analogue. Its chemical name is D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide. Given alone, ribavirin has little effect on the course of hepatitis C. Given with IFN, it significantly augments the rate of sustained virologic response. The adult dosage is 10.6 mg/kg orally once daily or in 2 divided doses. Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonists Class Summary These agents directly stimulate bone marrow platelet production to provide stable platelet counts to allow therapy with interferons. Eltrombopag (Promacta) Oral thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist. Interacts with transmembrane domain of human TPO receptor and induces megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitor cells. Indicated for treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based therapy.  Hepatitis C. Causes of chronic liver disease.
