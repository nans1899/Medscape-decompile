                    <para>Pectus excavatum occurs in an estimated 1 in 300-500 births, with a male predominance (male-to-female ratio of 3:1). The condition is typically noticed at birth, and more than two thirds of cases are diagnosed within the first year of life. Worsening of the chest’s appearance and the onset of symptoms are usually reported during rapid bone growth seen in puberty and early teenage years.<sup>

                    </sup>Many patients are not brought to the attention of a pediatric surgeon until the patient and the family have noticed such changes. Despite the lack of an identifiable genetic marker, the familial occurrence of pectus deformity is reported in 35% of cases.<sup>

                    <para>This topic focuses on the operative technique known as the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). It was originally described by Dr. Nuss and, for that reason, it is also known as the Nuss technique or pectus bar procedure. Nuss performed the first minimally invasive operation for the correction of pectus excavatum in the 1980s. Not until May of 1997 was this new and innovative technique introduced to the American Pediatric Surgical Association and, subsequently, published in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc3">[3]</link>
                    </sup>Because of the early excellent results obtained with this new technique and because of the less radical nature of the operation (compared to the open Ravitch technique),<sup>

                    </sup>the popularity of this approach has grown dramatically.<sup>

A normal chest index is around 2.5. Patients with an index greater than 3.2 have a fairly pronounced and severe pectus excavatum and will typically benefit from operative correction.<sup>

                    <para>Symptomatic patients with pectus excavatum typically experience occasional episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath with exertion, and decreased exercise tolerance. Such patients usually have abnormal pulmonary function tests and an echocardiogram may demonstrate <link type="content" ref="155618-overview">mitral</link> and <link type="content" ref="158484-overview">tricuspid valve regurgitation</link>. <link type="content" ref="155494-overview">Mitral valve prolapse</link> is also commonly seen on the echocardiogram.<sup>

                    </sup>
                    </para>
                    <para>Many patients with mild to moderate pectus excavatum do not report any significant shortness of breath. However, upon further questioning, one may find that the child is unable to keep up with their peers during play and physical activity.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc14">[14]</link>
                    </sup>They usually report getting tired more easily. Another common observation in children with pectus excavatum is that they are very shy and reserved about their physical appearance. Frequently, as summer comes around, they don't want to take their shirt off for sports, swimming, or around other children. The psychosocial stress caused by the abnormal chest can be quite severe and result in a major adjustment disorder, depression, and even suicide ideation later in life.<sup>

                    </para>
                    <para>The most common goal in operative repair of pectus excavatum is to correct the chest deformity. As noted above, this is particularly important in teenagers, in whom the abnormal appearance of the chest can result in significant problems related to body image and self-esteem. Thus, the desire to improve the appearance of the chest is considered an appropriate medical indication for surgery.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc17">[17]</link>

                    </para>
                    <para>The current recommendations support the use of MIRPE in patients aged 5-20 years. The ideal age for undergoing this operation has been established at 8-12 years because the chest wall is still very malleable, stabilization of the bar is easily achieved, thoracic epidural can be safely placed, and the child is mature enough to understand the operation and postoperative instructions, particularly incentive spirometry, which is essential for minimizing pulmonary problems after surgery.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc18">[18]</link>

                    </para>
                    <para>Of note, one should not view operative correction of pectus excavatum as an operation limited exclusively to pediatric patients. Indeed, the open technique has been used in adult patients with excellent results. However, experience with the MIRPE in adult patients has been limited to a few cases, reported in anecdotes.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc19">[19]</link>
                    </sup>
                    </para>
                    <para>Early results seem to indicate that similar principles apply and that operative correction using MIRPE can be achieved in adult patients. Limiting factors include a larger chest wall and poor malleability of the ribs, cartilage, and sternum. A surgeon experienced in the field of chest wall malformations must carefully evaluate adult patients to determine which operation would best correct the anatomical deformity.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc20">[20]</link>
                    </sup>Moreover, adult patients with pectus excavatum who undergo open-heart surgery have significant displacement and rotation of the heart to the left chest. This can make the operative approach to the heart at the time of open-heart surgery very challenging. With this in mind, elective repair of the pectus deformity prior to open-heart surgery may be indicated in selected adult cases. </para>

                    <para>Not all patients with pectus excavatum are considered candidates for corrective surgery. The decision to undergo surgery is based on clinical symptoms and severity of the deformity. The surgeon, patient, and immediate family must reach a consensus as to the benefits of operative repair of the child with pectus excavatum. The morbidity and mortality of the surgical intervention must be taken into consideration.</para>

                    <title>Procedure Planning</title>
                    <para>Patients must be selected carefully for the procedure. Preoperative assessment may include pulmonary function testing (PFT) and CT scan of the chest without contrast. The CT scan allows for determination of the preoperative Haller index (as previously described). Patients with a Haller index greater than 3.2 are considered candidates for the minimally invasive repair. The PFT typically demonstrates mild changes in pulmonary volumes (restrictive pattern).<sup>

                    </sup>Prepubertal patients have a more flexible rib cage, which facilitates reconstruction and remodeling of the ribs and sternum. Younger patients typically experience less postoperative pain and discomfort when compared to teenagers and young adults.<sup>

                    <title>Outcomes</title>
                    <para>Several studies have been published that evaluate the short and long-term outcomes of patients following minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum. The overall patient and family satisfaction has been considered very good, with excellent and good results reported in more than 90% of cases.<sup>

                    </sup>
                    </para>
                    <para>In 2000, one multi-institutional study, which reviewed 251 cases of MIRPE, demonstrated a significant rate of complications (the overall incidence rate of complications was almost 20%).<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc22">[22]</link>
                    </sup>The most common complication requiring reoperation was displacement of the retrosternal stainless steel support bar (reported to occur in 9.5% of all patients). Such displacement can include a 90° rotation, a 180° rotation, or a lateral migration. Teenaged patients are at higher risk for complications, particularly pectus bar displacement, probably because of the increased pressure on the bar generated by a larger chest and more rigid chest cage. </para>
                    <para>Review of the literature has demonstrated that a relatively high rate of complications was reported when many different surgeons performed the operation.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc24|refsrc22">[24, 22]</link>
                    </sup>This probably reflects the learning curve associated with the introduction of this new technique. Since the first MIRPE was performed, the bar has been modified 4 times and is now strong enough to withstand the pressure of even the most severe deformity. Factors contributing to the suboptimal results reported include the fact that the bar was too soft, was removed too soon, or was not stabilized adequately.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc26">[26]</link>
                    </sup>Experience has shown that stabilization of the bar is absolutely essential for success and the use of a lateral stabilizing bar and the third point of fixation (when appropriate) can minimize the occurrence of bar displacement.<sup>

                    </sup>Note that this improvement in cardiopulmonary function is not necessarily seen during the time that the support bar is still in place. For that reason, functional outcomes should not be evaluated until the patient has completed treatment with bar removal. Of note, the dreaded complication of chest wall constriction after Ravitch repair of pectus excavatum has never been reported with the minimally invasive technique. </para>
                    <para>Some surgeons have discussed what technique (MIRPE vs open surgery) provides the best outcome in patients with pectus excavatum.<sup>

                    </sup>Although many surgeons with expertise in the management of children with chest wall deformities have shown some bias toward the use of the Nuss technique, no prospective randomized published data is available to support this approach.</para>
                    <para>Since the introduction of thoracoscopy and lateral stabilizers, as well as the third point of fixation technique, bar displacement has become quite unlikely, with an estimated incidence of less than 2.5%.<sup>

                    </para>
                    <para>Another significant advantage of MIRPE over the open surgical procedure is that the dreaded complication of "thoracic constriction" (Jeune syndrome) does not seem to occur with this new technique.<sup>

                    </sup>Chest wall constriction has been described in a few patients following extensive open pectus excavatum operations. Apparently, the bone growth center can be affected, which results in restriction of chest wall growth with marked limitation of ventilatory function. Such patients are very symptomatic and cannot compete in running games. The forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second is typically decreased by more than 50% of predicted reference range levels. </para>
                    <para>With the MIRPE, because no resection or incision is made on ribs or cartilages, such a complication does not appear to be a problem.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc8">[8]</link>
                    </sup>Once the cartilage and bony structures are remodeled, normal or improved pulmonary function is established and the flexibility and malleability of the chest remains unaffected. </para>
                    <para>Critics of the MIRPE claim that the Nuss procedure is too invasive, risky, and not pain free. Proponents argue that this new approach, compared with the open surgery (modified Ravitch operation), eliminates the need for an anterior chest wall incision with creation of pectoralis muscle flaps, resection of several ribs and cartilages, and sternal osteotomies. The MIRPE allows for a much shorter operating time, minimal blood loss, and minimal surgical chest wall scar. Moreover, the stability and strength of the chest wall is not compromised as it can be with the open repair. </para>
                    <para>Data published in 2011 by the multi-center study group evaluating the pulmonary functional outcome of pediatric patients with pectus excavatum treated with MIRPE has clearly demonstrated that the increasing severity of pectus excavatum is associated with reduced pulmonary function and that the Nuss operation can effectively reverse that process.<sup>

Once the bar, stabilizer, and sutures are freed from the surrounding tissues, the pectus bar can be pulled out of the chest, as illustrated in the image below. The bar is pulled out using an instrument equivalent to a bone hook, such that steady traction is applied and the bar is removed with its curvature brought almost under the operating room table.

This provides the surgeon with visual information as to where the bar will be placed.</para>
                    <para>At this time, the measurement of the Lorenz pectus bar is determined using the marks made on the chest. The length of the Lorenz bar should be measured from the mid-axillary line in one side to the opposite mid-axillary line. The length of the bar is measured in inches and will be 1-2 cm less than the measurement taken. A typical measurement for a teenage patient may range from 12-15 inches (30-38 cm). The image below illustrates some of the different sizes available when choosing the bar that best fits the patient.</para>

                    <para>A skin tunnel is raised anteriorly from both incisions to the top of the pectus ridge at the previously selected intercostal space; the skin pocket is extended posteriorly to allow for the distal end of the pectus bar to hug the chest wall posterior to the midaxillary line. </para>
                    <para>A 5-mm thoracoscope is inserted at this point. The authors recommend placement of a 5-mm blunt trocar 1-2 intercostal spaces below the space that has been chosen for the pectus bar on the patient's right side. A 30° (5-mm) thoracoscope provides excellent visualization of the pleural cavity, lung, and mediastinal structures. If necessary, the scope can be used bilaterally. Insufflating the pleural cavity with carbon dioxide is rarely necessary; in most cases, controlled ventilation by the anesthesiologist with small tidal volumes results in limited lung expansion and good thoracoscopic visualization of vital structures. </para>
                    <para>Using a thin but deep retractor, the skin incisions are elevated and the intercostal space previously marked is identified. An S-shaped device known as the Lorenz pectus introducer is inserted through the appropriate right intercostal space at the top of the pectus ridge (usually at the level of the midclavicular line), in line with the point that corresponds to the deepest depression of the sternum (previously marked). The introducer is slowly advanced across the anterior mediastinal space immediately under the sternum with careful videoscopic guidance. Always facing the point of the instrument anteriorly (away from the heart) and maintaining contact with the sternum to avoid injury to mediastinal structures is important. </para>
                    <para>The sternum is forcefully lifted as the instrument is passed to the contralateral side. Thoracoscopic visualization and monitoring for cardiac ectopy is important to ensure that the instrument is not near the heart or pericardial sac. </para>

                    <para>If, after the bar is flipped, the correction of the pectus excavatum is not ideal (either under corrected or overcorrected), the bar is flipped back, pulled back out, and bent again to fit the patient's chest in order to achieve the best possible correction of the deformity. If pressure has caused the bar to straighten, it is turned over and, using small hand held benders, the curvature is increased as appropriate. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. Typically, only one bar is necessary to correct the deformity, but, occasionally, a second bar may be necessary. The second bar can be placed above or below the first one. </para>

                    <para>Once the bar is in place, determining its stability is imperative. Such assessment dictates the need for placement of a stabilizing bar. The stabilizer serves to limit rotation of the pectus bar and is sutured around the bar and to the muscle only after being properly fitted. Teenagers usually require one stabilizer bar that can be placed on either side of the pectus bar. We prefer to place one stabilizer on the right side of the chest. If the bar does not feel stable, a second stabilizer on the left side can be placed. The stabilizers are secured to the pectus bar using # 1 stainless steel wire sutures. </para>
                    <para>With the bar properly placed and stabilized, figure-of-8 sutures are placed to secure the bar and stabilizer to the lateral chest wall musculature. Number 0 nonabsorbable sutures (Prolene) are placed on the right side, and absorbable (Vicryl or PDS) sutures are placed on the opposite side. This prevents the need for re-opening both incisions at the time of bar removal. </para>
                    <para>Additionally, a third point-of-fixation suture can be placed on the anterior chest to the side of the sternum, around one rib and around the pectus bar, in order to provide another point of fixation for the bar, minimizing the chance of bar displacement.

A small temporary red-rubber tube placed through the trocar site can be used to evacuate any residual intra-pleural air. The tube should be connected to suction or placed under water seal in order to allow elimination of most of the air inside the pleural cavity. </para>

                    <para>An association between anterior chest wall deformities and scoliosis has been described in the literature but is poorly defined. Apparently, only 4-5% of patients with severe anterior chest wall deformities have scoliosis of sufficient magnitude to warrant evaluation by a spinal deformity physician.<sup>

                    </para>
                    <para>The relationship between anterior chest wall deformity and scoliosis is most clear in patients with Marfan syndrome.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc35">[35]</link>
                    </sup>Patients with Marfan syndrome who have scoliosis are at high risk for progression of the deformity to unacceptable levels and have not historically responded well to brace therapy.<sup>
                        <link type="references" ref="refsrc36">[36]</link>
                    </sup>Because of the association between pectus deformities and scoliosis, carefully examine patients with anterior chest wall deformities for signs of scoliosis and perform radiography if indicated. Patients younger than 5 years who present with spinal deformity are at risk for adverse cardiopulmonary sequelae related to the scoliosis. The management of scoliosis in patients with anterior chest wall deformities follows the treatment principles outlined for patients with idiopathic scoliosis.</para>

Patient mobilization is permitted on the first or second postoperative day by flexing the bed at the hip level and keeping the back straight. The patient is instructed to avoid trunk rotation or to sit in bed with the thoracic spine flexed. The epidural catheter is generally removed on the third postoperative day, and the patient should be fully ambulatory after that point. </para>
                    <para>After the third postoperative day, the patient is required to ambulate with the assistance of physical and occupational therapy. From the fourth or fifth operative day on, the patient is instructed in performing limited exercises at home to facilitate recovery. Ambulation is strongly encouraged from that point. The patient is discharged home once pain is adequately controlled with oral medications. The average length of stay is 4-7 days. Good posture with a straight back is very important, even after discharge. </para>
                    <para>Once home, the patient is allowed to sleep in any position that is comfortable. Again, bending at the hip and slouching are discouraged, particularly in the first month. Regular activity is permitted as pain reduces and mobility increases. Heavy lifting is not permitted for 1 month following surgery. Physical fitness program should be started 30 days after corrective surgery in order to promote healing and remodeling of the chest wall. Contact sports should be avoided for at least 6 months, particularly in older children and teenagers, since a direct blow to the chest may predispose to bar displacement. </para>
