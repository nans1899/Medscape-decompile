            <para>The focus of this review is on the effects of alcohol on the myocardium and its role as a cause of heart failure due to <link type="content" ref="152696-overview">dilated cardiomyopathy</link> (DC). For nearly 150 years, alcohol consumption has been associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Observations during the second half of the 19th century described cardiac enlargement seen at autopsy and heart failure symptoms in persons who had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. </para>
            <para>During the first half of the 20th century, the concept of beriberi heart disease (ie, thiamine deficiency) was present throughout the medical literature, and the idea that alcohol had any direct effect on the myocardium was doubted. Epidemics of heart failure in persons who had consumed beer contaminated with arsenic in the 1900s and cobalt in the 1960s also obscured the observation that alcohol could exhibit a direct toxic effect. In the 1950s, evidence began to emerge that supported the idea of a direct toxic myocardial effect of alcohol, and research during the last 25 years has been particularly productive in characterizing the disease entity of alcoholic cardiomyopathy (AC). </para>
            <para>Ultimately, AC is a clinical diagnosis made in a patient presenting with a constellation of findings that includes a history of excessive alcohol intake, possible physical signs of alcohol abuse (eg, parotid disease, telangiectasia or spider angiomata, mental status changes, cirrhosis), heart failure, and supportive evidence consistent with <link type="content" ref="1612303-overview">DC</link>. Hypertension due to alcohol may be a confounding comorbidity in that it may contribute to LV dysfunction; therefore, LV dysfunction due to hypertension must be differentiated from pure AC. </para>

            <para>Alcohol use has also been shown to have numerous effects on the cardiovascular system other than heart failure. It has been associated with arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, other supraventricular arrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions), hypertension, stroke, and sudden death.<sup>
                  <link type="references" ref="refsrc2">[2]</link>
               </sup>In addition, the literature reports alcohol withdrawal being associated with takotsubo, or stress-induced, cardiomyopathy. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that light to moderate alcohol consumption (ie, 1-2 drinks per d or 3-9 drinks per wk) decreases the risk of cardiac events such as myocardial infarction. </para>

         <title>Cardiac Effects of Alcohol</title>
         <pgroup>
            <para>Long-term alcohol use has been implicated as the etiology of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in as many as one third of cases of <link type="content" ref="895187-overview">DC</link>. The mechanism by which alcohol causes cardiac damage remains unclear. Over many years, several theories have arisen based on clinical and scientific data obtained in human and animal studies, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, derangements of fatty acid metabolism/transport, and accelerated protein catabolism.<sup>
                  <link type="references" ref="refsrc3">[3]</link>
               </sup>
            </para>
            <para>The original theories regarding the mechanism focused on nutritional deficiencies (eg, thiamine deficiency), secondary exposures (eg, tobacco, cobalt, arsenic), and other comorbidities (eg, hypertension). However, although these mechanisms may play a role in selected patients, most evidence in the literature indicates that the effects of alcohol on the myocardium are independent of these factors and that the effect is a direct toxic result of ethanol or its metabolites. </para>
            <para>Some studies have suggested that a genetic vulnerability exists to the myocardial effects of alcohol consumption. Individuals with certain mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes (DD genotype) may be particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of alcohol. Exactly how these genetic variables create this higher risk is not known.</para>
            <para>Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to have a significant role in the development and complications of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Long-term alcohol use has been linked to damage of mitochondrial DNA, increasing the risk of mutations.<sup>
                  <link type="references" ref="refsrc4">[4]</link>
               </sup>
            </para>
            <para>In addition, alcohol has been shown to have a negative effect on net protein synthesis. Many studies have shown this result, and it remains a topic of ongoing investigation and speculation. The exact manner in which alcohol produces this effect is not known, but the effect is consistent, is observed throughout the heart, and may be exaggerated under stressful conditions. </para>
            <para>To identify the causative agent of alcoholic <link type="content" ref="152535-overview">cardiomyopathy</link>, investigators administered ethanol to rats pretreated with inhibitors of ethanol metabolism. Use of ethanol alone or ethanol with an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor resulted in a 25% decrease in protein synthesis. When the rats were given an inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to increase levels of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde, an 80% decrease in protein synthesis occurred. Based on these data, acute ethanol-induced injury appears to be mediated by ethanol and acetaldehyde; the latter may play a more important role. </para>
            <para>Acetaldehyde is a potent oxidant and, as such, increases oxidative stress, leading to the formation of oxygen radicals, with subsequent endothelial and tissue dysfunction. Acetaldehyde may also result in impairment of mitochondrial phosphorylation. Mitochondria play an essential role in cellular metabolism, and disruption of their function can have profound effects on the entire cell. The myocyte mitochondria in the hearts of persons exposed to alcohol are clearly abnormal in structure, and many believe that this may be an important factor in the development of AC. </para>
            <para>A study in a rat model using an alcohol dehydrogenase transgene that results in elevated levels of acetaldehyde demonstrated a change in calcium metabolism at the intracellular level and a decrease in peak shortening and shortening velocity. This was interpreted by the authors as suggesting that acetaldehyde plays a key role in the cardiac dysfunction seen after alcohol intake. Others have suggested that an acute decrease in mitochondrial glutathione content may play a role in mitochondrial damage and implicate oxidative stress as a contributor in this process. </para>
            <para>The formation of fatty acid ethyl esters during the metabolism of alcohol and specific genetic defects in fatty acid ethyl ester synthase (which metabolizes these esters and may predispose individuals to these toxic effects) have been proposed to result in further impairment of mitochondrial phosphorylation. Acetaldehyde has also been associated with coronary vasospasm and the release of troponin T in the acute setting. The latter effect can be blocked by the administration of propranolol, implicating beta-adrenergic stimulation as an effect of acetaldehyde. </para>
            <para>Other proposed mechanisms of injury include a direct inhibition of calcium-myofilament interaction, free radical induced lipopigment accumulation within the myocyte and inhibition of protein synthesis, an inflammatory or myocarditislike response (possibly secondary to antibodies formed against protein-acetaldehyde adducts), reduced receptor expression, abnormal membrane structure, disruption of zinc homeostasis, and an increase in myocardial superoxide dismutase activity (resulting in an antioxidant imbalance).<sup>

         <pgroup>
            <para>Excessive intake of alcohol may result in increased systemic blood pressure in a dose-response relationship, and this may contribute to chronic myocardial dysfunction. Patients who consume more than 2 drinks per day have a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in hypertension compared with persons who do not drink alcohol, and this effect is most prominent when the daily intake of alcohol exceeds 5 drinks. Because hypertension may directly contribute to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, this may be a confounding comorbidity in persons who abuse alcohol, and it should be differentiated from pure forms of AC. </para>
            <para>In 1989, Urbano-Marquez et al reported on 48 men with alcohol abuse with a mean daily intake of 243 g of alcohol and showed (1) an inverse relationship between total lifetime intake and ejection fraction and fractional shortening and (2) a direct relationship between total lifetime intake and LV mass. In persons who consumed 70 g of ethanol (or the equivalent of 7 oz of whiskey, 20 oz of wine, or 72 oz of beer [ie, six 12-oz cans]) per day for 20 years, 36% had an abnormal ejection fraction. Age and nutritional status appeared to play little or no role.<sup>

               </sup>
            </para>
            <para>In a 1986 study, Richardson et al concluded that continuous, rather than episodic, drinking was a major risk factor for the development of heart failure and that this effect was unrelated to the hypertensive effect of alcohol. In the study, the authors evaluated 38 patients with nonischemic DC. Of these persons, 18 were classified as heavy drinkers (ie, 80 g/d or a lifetime dose of 250 kg), and 20 were classified as abstinent or light drinkers. Those classified as heavy drinkers all were men who predominantly drank beer.<sup>

            </para>
            <para>Other studies and reviews have also quoted quantities similar to those mentioned above, and the type of beverage consumed appeared to be irrelevant. </para>
            <para>Binge drinking induces a systemic inflammatory reaction, which may lead to alcohol-induced myocardial inflammation. One study indicated that patients who repeatedly expose themselves to excessive amounts of alcohol may demonstrate evidence on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of alcohol-induced myocardial inflammation but not show deterioration in indices of LV performance. The study did not provide evidence of an absolute acute risk of cardiac events involved with binge drinking, and the clinical significance of the findings requires further investigation.<sup>

Several authors have reported that although AC is a disease that affects males more often than females (due to a higher rate of alcohol abuse in men), females may be more sensitive to alcohol's cardiotoxic effects. </para>

            <para>The natural history of patients with alcoholic <link type="content" ref="153153-overview">cardiomyopathy</link> depends greatly on each patient's ability to cease alcohol consumption completely. Multiple case reports and small retrospective and prospective studies have clearly documented marked improvement in or, in some patients, normalization of cardiac function with abstinence. The following reports and studies provide impressive data on the utility of abstinence and the confirmation of alcohol consumption as a cause of DC. </para>
            <para>Nakanishi et al identified 11 patients with AC and reported significant improvement in 8 of them after they abstained from alcohol use. In addition, a marked worsening was seen in the 3 patients who continued to abuse alcohol, including death from heart failure in 2 patients.<sup>

            <para>A 12-month observational study of 20 patients with AC noted smaller cavity diameters, better clinical evaluation findings, and fewer hospitalizations in the 10 patients who abstained from alcohol use. </para>
            <para>Guillo and colleagues evaluated 14 patients with AC over a 3-year period with serial examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), stress tests, echocardiograms, and MUGA scans. Of the 3 patients who continued to drink, 1 was lost to follow-up and 2 died. One patient underwent heart transplantation within the 3 years of follow-up observation, and 1 patient died from tamponade after an endomyocardial biopsy. Nine of the original 14 patients completed the 36-month follow-up period, 6 patients had marked improvement in symptoms and increased ejection fractions. The other 3 patients had no change in ejection fraction, one patient cut back alcohol consumption, and another patient resumed use after a period of abstinence.<sup>

            <para>A 1- and 4-year follow-up study of 55 men with alcoholism showed that abstinence and controlled drinking of up to 60 g/day (4 drinks) resulted in comparable improvement in LV ejection fraction. Ten patients who continued to drink higher amounts of alcohol all died during the follow-up period. </para>
            <para>Demakis and colleagues found that, overall, the 2 factors that were associated with a better prognosis in AC were abstinence and a shorter duration of symptoms before the initiation of therapy. In their study, perhaps the largest evaluation of the natural history of AC, the investigators prospectively followed 57 patients with AC and divided them into 3 groups: 15 patients who improved clinically, 12 patients who remained stable, and 30 patients whose conditions deteriorated. Of the 39 patients who continued to drink, only 4 patients improved. Eleven of the 18 patients who abstained improved; however, the condition of 3 patients who abstained continued to deteriorate.<sup>

            <para>In 1996, Prazak et al conducted a retrospective study comparing 23 patients with AC to 52 patients with idiopathic DC and found that the 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates for AC were 100%, 81%, and 81%, respectively, compared with 89%, 48%, and 30%, respectively, for idiopathic DC. When transplant-free survival was compared between the 2 groups, the difference was more impressive, with 10-year survival rates of 81% and 20% for the AC and idiopathic DC patients, respectively. The 2 groups had similar ejection fractions, New York Heart Association class symptoms, and overall LV volume. The sole endpoint was all-cause mortality.<sup>

Histologically, light microscopy reveals interstitial fibrosis (a finding that has been shown to be prevented by zinc supplementation in the mouse model), myocyte necrosis with hypertrophy of other myocytes, and evidence of inflammation. Electron microscopy reveals mitochondrial enlargement and disorganization, dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, fat and glycogen deposition, and dilatation of the intercalating discs. </para>

The efficacy of abstinence has been shown in persons with early disease (eg, prior to the onset of severe myocardial fibrosis) and in individuals with more advanced disease (see Prognosis). </para>
            <para>Medical therapy for AC is identical to conventional therapy for other forms of heart failure. This includes treatment with an ACE inhibitor and with digoxin (for patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction), as well as the symptomatic use of diuretics. Newer therapies, such as beta blockers in stable patients without decompensated heart failure, are also used. </para>
            <para>Electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, should be corrected promptly because of the risk of arrhythmia and sudden death. </para>
            <para>Although anticoagulation may be of benefit to patients with profound LV dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, the risks must be weighed heavily in this patient population. </para>
            <para>Thiamine (200 mg once daily), multivitamins, vitamin B-12, folate, and mineral supplementation are beneficial for patients with AC because of the significant prevalence of concomitant nutritional or electrolyte deficiencies in these patients.
