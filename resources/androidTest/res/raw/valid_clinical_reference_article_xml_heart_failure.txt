            <pgroup>
               <para>Heart failure is the pathophysiologic state in which the heart, via an abnormality of cardiac function (detectable or not), fails to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues or is able to do so only with an elevated diastolic filling pressure.</para>
               <para>Heart failure (see the images below) may be caused by myocardial failure but may also occur in the presence of near-normal cardiac function under conditions of high demand. Heart failure always causes circulatory failure, but the converse is not necessarily the case, because various noncardiac conditions (eg, hypovolemic shock, septic shock) can produce circulatory failure in the presence of normal, modestly impaired, or even supranormal cardiac function. To maintain the pumping function of the heart, compensatory mechanisms increase blood volume, cardiac filling pressure, heart rate, and cardiac muscle mass. However, despite these mechanisms, there is progressive decline in the ability of the heart to contract and relax, resulting in worsening heart failure.</para>

                  </sup>This process eventually leads to remodeling, usually the eccentric type.

               <para>The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, along with the vasoactive substances endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vasopressin, causes vasoconstriction, which increases calcium afterload and, via an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), causes an increase in cytosolic calcium entry. The increased calcium entry into the myocytes augments myocardial contractility and impairs myocardial relaxation (lusitropy).</para>
               <para>The calcium overload may induce arrhythmias and lead to sudden death. The increase in afterload and myocardial contractility (known as inotropy) and the impairment in myocardial lusitropy lead to an increase in myocardial energy expenditure and a further decrease in cardiac output. The increase in myocardial energy expenditure leads to myocardial cell death/apoptosis, which results in heart failure and further reduction in cardiac output, perpetuating a cycle of further increased neurohumoral stimulation and further adverse hemodynamic and myocardial responses.</para>
               <para>In addition, the activation of the RAAS leads to salt and water retention, resulting in increased preload and further increases in myocardial energy expenditure. Increases in renin, mediated by decreased stretch of the glomerular afferent arteriole, reduce delivery of chloride to the macula densa and increase beta1-adrenergic activity as a response to decreased cardiac output. This results in an increase in angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and, in turn, aldosterone levels, causing stimulation of the release of aldosterone. Ang II, along with ET-1, is crucial in maintaining effective intravascular homeostasis mediated by vasoconstriction and aldosterone-induced salt and water retention.</para>

                  </sup>In heart failure, this mechanism for replacement becomes overwhelmed by an even faster increase in the rate of myocyte loss. This imbalance of hypertrophy and death over regeneration is the final common pathway at the cellular level for the progression of remodeling and heart failure.</para>

               <para>Research indicates that local cardiac Ang II production (which decreases lusitropy, increases inotropy, and increases afterload) leads to increased myocardial energy expenditure. Ang II has also been shown in vitro and in vivo to increase the rate of myocyte apoptosis.<sup>
                     <link type="references" ref="refsrc19">[19]</link>
                  </sup>In this fashion, Ang II has similar actions to norepinephrine in heart failure.</para>
               <para>Ang II also mediates myocardial cellular hypertrophy and may promote progressive loss of myocardial function. The neurohumoral factors above lead to myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, resulting in increased myocardial volume and increased myocardial mass, as well as myocyte loss. As a result, the cardiac architecture changes, which, in turn, leads to further increase in myocardial volume and mass.</para>

               <title>Myocytes and myocardial remodeling</title>
               <para>In the failing heart, increased myocardial volume is characterized by larger myocytes approaching the end of their life cycle.<sup>
                     <link type="references" ref="refsrc20">[20]</link>
                  </sup>As more myocytes drop out, an increased load is placed on the remaining myocardium, and this unfavorable environment is transmitted to the progenitor cells responsible for replacing lost myocytes.</para>
               <para>Progenitor cells become progressively less effective as the underlying pathologic process worsens and myocardial failure accelerates. These features—namely, the increased myocardial volume and mass, along with a net loss of myocytes—are the hallmark of myocardial remodeling. This remodeling process leads to early adaptive mechanisms, such as augmentation of stroke volume (Frank-Starling mechanism) and decreased wall stress (Laplace's law), and, later, to maladaptive mechanisms such as increased myocardial oxygen demand, myocardial ischemia, impaired contractility, and arrhythmogenesis.</para>
               <para>As heart failure advances, there is a relative decline in the counterregulatory effects of endogenous vasodilators, including nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins (PGs), bradykinin (BK), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). This decline occurs simultaneously with the increase in vasoconstrictor substances from the RAAS and the adrenergic system, which fosters further increases in vasoconstriction and thus preload and afterload. This results in cellular proliferation, adverse myocardial remodeling, and antinatriuresis, with total body fluid excess and worsening of heart failure symptoms.</para>

               <title>Systolic and diastolic failure</title>
               <para>Systolic and diastolic heart failure each result in a decrease in stroke volume. This leads to activation of peripheral and central baroreflexes and chemoreflexes that are capable of eliciting marked increases in sympathetic nerve traffic.</para>
               <para>While there are commonalities in the neurohormonal responses to decreased stroke volume, the neurohormone-mediated events that follow have been most clearly elucidated for individuals with systolic heart failure. The ensuing elevation in plasma norepinephrine directly correlates with the degree of cardiac dysfunction and has significant prognostic implications. Norepinephrine, while directly toxic to cardiac myocytes, is also responsible for a variety of signal-transduction abnormalities, such as down-regulation of beta1-adrenergic receptors, uncoupling of beta2-adrenergic receptors, and increased activity of inhibitory G-protein. Changes in beta1-adrenergic receptors result in overexpression and promote myocardial hypertrophy.</para>

               <title>ANP and BNP</title>
               <para>ANP and BNP are endogenously generated peptides activated in response to atrial and ventricular volume/pressure expansion. ANP and BNP are released from the atria and ventricles, respectively, and both promote vasodilation and natriuresis. Their hemodynamic effects are mediated by decreases in ventricular filling pressures, owing to reductions in cardiac preload and afterload. BNP, in particular, produces selective afferent arteriolar vasodilation and inhibits sodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. It also inhibits renin and aldosterone release and, therefore, adrenergic activation. ANP and BNP are elevated in chronic heart failure. BNP, in particular, has potentially important diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications.</para>

               <para>Other vasoactive systems that play a role in the pathogenesis of heart failure include the ET receptor system, the adenosine receptor system, vasopressin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).<sup>
                     <link type="references" ref="refsrc21">[21]</link>
                  </sup>ET, a substance produced by the vascular endothelium, may contribute to the regulation of myocardial function, vascular tone, and peripheral resistance in heart failure. Elevated levels of ET-1 closely correlate with the severity of heart failure. ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and has exaggerated vasoconstrictor effects in the renal vasculature, reducing renal plasma blood flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and sodium excretion.</para>
               <para>TNF-alpha has been implicated in response to various infectious and inflammatory conditions. Elevations in TNF-alpha levels have been consistently observed in heart failure and seem to correlate with the degree of myocardial dysfunction. Some studies suggest that local production of TNF-alpha may have toxic effects on the myocardium, thus worsening myocardial systolic and diastolic function.</para>
               <para>In individuals with systolic dysfunction, therefore, the neurohormonal responses to decreased stroke volume result in temporary improvement in systolic blood pressure and tissue perfusion. However, in all circumstances, the existing data support the notion that these neurohormonal responses contribute to the progression of myocardial dysfunction in the long term.</para>

               <para>In diastolic heart failure (heart failure with normal ejection fraction [HFNEF]), the same pathophysiologic processes occur that lead to decreased cardiac output in systolic heart failure, but they do so in response to a different set of hemodynamic and circulatory environmental factors that depress cardiac output.<sup>

               <para>In HFNEF, altered relaxation and increased stiffness of the ventricle (due to delayed calcium uptake by the myocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum and delayed calcium efflux from the myocyte) occur in response to an increase in ventricular afterload (pressure overload). The impaired relaxation of the ventricle then leads to impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle (LV).</para>
               <para>Morris et al found that RV subendocardial systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction, as detected by echocardiographic strain rate imaging, are common in patients with HFNEF. This dysfunction is potentially associated with the same fibrotic processes that affect the subendocardial layer of the LV and, to a lesser extent, with RV pressure overload. This may play a role in the symptomatology of patients with HFNEF.<sup>

               <para>A rise in filling pressure is the movement of the ventricle up along its pressure-volume curve to a steeper portion, as may occur in conditions such as volume overload secondary to acute valvular regurgitation or acute LV failure due to myocarditis.</para>
               <para>A shift to a steeper ventricular pressure-volume curve results, most commonly, not only from increased ventricular mass and wall thickness (as observed in aortic stenosis and long-standing hypertension) but also from infiltrative disorders (eg, amyloidosis), endomyocardial fibrosis, and myocardial ischemia.</para>
               <para>Parallel upward displacement of the diastolic pressure-volume curve is generally referred to as a decrease in ventricular distensibility. This is usually caused by extrinsic compression of the ventricles.</para>

               <para>Increases in diastolic pressure lead to increased myocardial energy expenditure, remodeling of the ventricle, increased myocardial oxygen demand, myocardial ischemia, and eventual progression of the maladaptive mechanisms of the heart that lead to decompensated heart failure.</para>

Uncontrolled hypertension is the second most common cause of decompensation, followed closely by cardiac arrhythmias (most commonly, atrial fibrillation). Arrhythmias, particularly ventricular arrhythmias, can be life threatening. Also, patients with one form of underlying heart disease that may be well compensated can develop heart failure when a second form of heart disease ensues. For example, a patient with chronic hypertension and asymptomatic LVH may be asymptomatic until a myocardial infarction (MI) develops and precipitates heart failure.</para>
               <para>Systemic infection or the development of unrelated illness can also lead to heart failure. Systemic infection precipitates heart failure by increasing total metabolism as a consequence of fever, discomfort, and cough, increasing the hemodynamic burden on the heart. Septic shock, in particular, can precipitate heart failure by the release of endotoxin-induced factors that can depress myocardial contractility.</para>
               <para>Cardiac infection and inflammation can also endanger the heart. Myocarditis or infective endocarditis may directly impair myocardial function and exacerbate existing heart disease. The anemia, fever, and tachycardia that frequently accompany these processes are also deleterious. In the case of infective endocarditis, the additional valvular damage that ensues may precipitate cardiac decompensation.</para>
               <para>Patients with heart failure, particularly when confined to bed, are at high risk of developing pulmonary emboli, which can increase the hemodynamic burden on the right ventricle by further elevating right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure, possibly causing fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia.</para>
               <para>Intense, prolonged physical exertion or severe fatigue, such as may result from prolonged travel or emotional crisis, is a relatively common precipitant of cardiac decompensation. The same is true of exposure to severe climate change (ie, the individual comes in contact with a hot, humid environment or a bitterly cold one).</para>
               <para>Excessive intake of water and/or sodium and the administration of cardiac depressants or drugs that cause salt retention are other factors that can lead to heart failure.</para>

               <para>The principal difference between exertional dyspnea in patients who are healthy and exertional dyspnea in patients with heart failure is the degree of activity necessary to induce the symptom. As heart failure first develops, exertional dyspnea may simply appear to be an aggravation of the breathlessness that occurs in healthy persons during activity, but as LV failure advances, the intensity of exercise resulting in breathlessness progressively declines; however, subjective exercise capacity and objective measures of LV performance at rest in patients with heart failure are not closely correlated. Exertional dyspnea, in fact, may be absent in sedentary patients.</para>

            <pgroup>
               <title>Orthopnea</title>
               <para>Orthopnea is an early symptom of heart failure and may be defined as dyspnea that develops in the recumbent position and is relieved with elevation of the head with pillows. As in the case of exertional dyspnea, the change in the number of pillows required is important. In the recumbent position, decreased pooling of blood in the lower extremities and abdomen occurs. Blood is displaced from the extrathoracic compartment to the thoracic compartment. The failing LV, operating on the flat portion of the Frank-Starling curve, cannot accept and pump out the extra volume of blood delivered to it without dilating. As a result, pulmonary venous and capillary pressures rise further, causing interstitial pulmonary edema, reduced pulmonary compliance, increased airway resistance, and dyspnea.</para>
               <para>Orthopnea occurs rapidly, often within a minute or two of recumbency, and develops when the patient is awake. Orthopnea may occur in any condition in which the vital capacity is low. Marked ascites, regardless of its etiology, is an important cause of orthopnea. In advanced LV failure, orthopnea may be so severe that the patient cannot lie down and must sleep sitting up in a chair or slumped over a table.</para>
               <para>Cough, particularly during recumbency, may be an "orthopnea equivalent." This nonproductive cough may be caused by pulmonary congestion and is relieved by the treatment of heart failure.</para>

               <title>Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea</title>
               <para>Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea usually occurs at night and is defined as the sudden awakening of the patient, after a couple of hours of sleep, with a feeling of severe anxiety, breathlessness, and suffocation. The patient may bolt upright in bed and gasp for breath. Bronchospasm increases ventilatory difficulty and the work of breathing and is a common complicating factor of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On chest auscultation, the bronchospasm associated with a heart failure exacerbation can be difficult to distinguish from an acute asthma exacerbation, although other clues from the cardiovascular examination should lead the examiner to the correct diagnosis. Both types of bronchospasm can be present in a single individual.</para>
               <para>In contrast to orthopnea, which may be relieved by immediately sitting up in bed, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea may require 30 minutes or longer in this position for relief. Episodes may be so frightening that the patient may be afraid to resume sleeping, even after the symptoms have subsided.</para>

            <pgroup>
               <para>Patients with mild heart failure appear to be in no distress after a few minutes of rest, but they may be obviously dyspneic during and immediately after moderate activity. Patients with LV failure may be dyspneic when lying flat without elevation of the head for more than a few minutes. Those with severe heart failure appear anxious and may exhibit signs of air hunger in this position.</para>
               <para>Patients with recent onset of heart failure are generally well nourished, but those with chronic severe heart failure are often malnourished and sometimes even cachectic. Chronic marked elevation of systemic venous pressure may produce exophthalmos and severe tricuspid regurgitation and may lead to visible pulsation of the eyes and of the neck veins. Central cyanosis, icterus, and malar flush may be evident in patients with severe heart failure.</para>
               <para>In mild or moderate heart failure, stroke volume is normal at rest; in severe heart failure, it is reduced, as reflected by a diminished pulse pressure and a dusky discoloration of the skin. With very severe heart failure, particularly if cardiac output has declined acutely, systolic arterial pressure may be reduced. The pulse may be weak, rapid, and thready; the proportional pulse pressure (pulse pressure/systolic pressure) may be markedly reduced. The proportional pulse pressure correlates reasonably well with cardiac output. In one study, when pulse pressure was less than 25%, it usually reflected a cardiac index of less than 2.2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>.</para>
               <para>Ascites occurs in patients with increased pressure in the hepatic veins and in the veins draining into the peritoneum and usually reflects long-standing systemic venous hypertension. Fever may be present in severe decompensated heart failure because of cutaneous vasoconstriction and impairment of heat loss.</para>
               <para>Increased adrenergic activity is manifested by tachycardia, diaphoresis, pallor, peripheral cyanosis with pallor and coldness of the extremities, and obvious distention of the peripheral veins secondary to venoconstriction. Diastolic arterial pressure may be slightly elevated.</para>
               <para>Rales heard over the lung bases are characteristic of heart failure of at least moderate severity. With acute pulmonary edema, rales are frequently accompanied by wheezing and expectoration of frothy, blood-tinged sputum. The absence of rales certainly does not exclude elevation of pulmonary capillary pressure due to LV failure.</para>
               <para>Systemic venous hypertension is manifested by jugular venous distention. Normally, jugular venous pressure declines with respiration; however, it increases in patients with heart failure, a finding known as the Kussmaul sign (also found in <link type="content" ref="157096-overview">constrictive pericarditis</link>). This reflects an increase in right atrial pressure and therefore right-sided heart failure.</para>
               <para>Hepatojugular reflux is the distention of the jugular vein induced by applying manual pressure over the liver; the patient's torso should be positioned at a 45° angle. Hepatojugular reflux occurs in patients with elevated left-sided filling pressures and reflects elevated capillary wedge pressure and left-sided heart failure.</para>
               <para>Although edema is a cardinal manifestation of heart failure, it does not correlate well with the level of systemic venous pressure. In patients with chronic LV failure and low cardiac output, extracellular fluid volume may be sufficiently expanded to cause edema in the presence of only slight elevations in systemic venous pressure. Usually, a substantial gain of extracellular fluid volume (ie, a minimum of 5 L in adults) must occur before peripheral edema develops. Edema in the absence of dyspnea or other signs of LV or RV failure is not solely indicative of heart failure and can be observed in many other conditions, including chronic venous insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, or other syndromes of hypoproteinemia or osmotic imbalance.</para>
               <para>Hepatomegaly is prominent in patients with chronic right-sided heart failure, but it may occur rapidly in acute heart failure. When hepatomegaly occurs acutely, the liver is usually tender. In patients with considerable tricuspid regurgitation, a prominent systolic pulsation of the liver, attributable to an enlarged right atrial V wave, is often noted. A presystolic pulsation of the liver, attributable to an enlarged right atrial A wave, can occur in tricuspid stenosis, constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy involving the right ventricle, and pulmonary hypertension (primary or secondary).</para>
               <para>Hydrothorax is most commonly observed in patients with hypertension involving both the systemic and pulmonary circulation. It is usually bilateral, although when unilateral, it is usually confined to the right side of the chest. When hydrothorax develops, dyspnea usually intensifies because of further reductions in vital capacity.</para>

               <title>Cardiac findings</title>
               <para>Protodiastolic (S<sub>3</sub>) gallop is the earliest cardiac physical finding in decompensated heart failure in the absence of severe mitral or tricuspid regurgitation or left-to-right shunts. The presence of an S<sub>3</sub> gallop in adults is important, pathologic, and often the most apparent finding on cardiac auscultation in patients with significant heart failure.</para>
               <para>Cardiomegaly is a nonspecific finding that nonetheless occurs in most patients with chronic heart failure. Notable exceptions include heart failure from acute MI, constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, valve or chordae tendineae rupture, or heart failure due to tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias.</para>
               <para>Pulsus alternans (during pulse palpation, this is the alternation of 1 strong and 1 weak beat without a change in the cycle length) occurs most commonly in heart failure due to increased resistance to LV ejection, as occurs in hypertension, aortic stenosis, coronary atherosclerosis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Pulsus alternans is usually associated with an S<sub>3</sub> gallop, signifies advanced myocardial disease, and often disappears with treatment of heart failure.</para>
               <para>Accentuation of P<sub>2</sub> heart sound is a cardinal sign of increased pulmonary artery pressure; it disappears or improves after treatment of heart failure. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation murmurs are often present in patients with decompensated heart failure because of ventricular dilatation. These murmurs often disappear or diminish when compensation is restored. Note that correlation between the intensity of the murmur of mitral regurgitation and its significance in patients with heart failure is poor. Severe mitral regurgitation may be accompanied by an unimpressively soft murmur.</para>
               <para>Cardiac cachexia is found in long-standing heart failure, particularly of the right ventricle, because of anorexia from hepatic and intestinal congestion and sometimes because of digitalis toxicity. Occasionally, impaired intestinal absorption of fat occurs, and rarely, protein-losing enteropathy occurs. Patients with heart failure may also exhibit increased total metabolism secondary to augmentation of myocardial oxygen consumption, excessive work of breathing, low-grade fever, and elevated levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF).</para>

Other gastrointestinal symptoms, caused by congestion of the hepatic and gastrointestinal venous circulation, include anorexia, bloating, nausea, and constipation. In preterminal heart failure, inadequate bowel perfusion can cause abdominal pain, distention, and bloody stools. Distinguishing right-sided heart failure from hepatic failure is often clinically difficult.</para>
               <para>Dyspnea, prominent in LV failure, becomes less prominent in isolated right-sided heart failure because of the absence of pulmonary congestion. On the other hand, when cardiac output becomes markedly reduced in patients with terminal right-sided heart failure (as may occur in isolated RV infarction and in the late stages of primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary thromboembolic disease), severe dyspnea may occur as a consequence of the reduced cardiac output, poor perfusion of respiratory muscles, hypoxemia, and metabolic acidosis.</para>

Also, the distance from the right atrium to the angle of the jaw may be no more than 8-10 cm, even when the individual is sitting upright. Uncompensated heart failure in an infant primarily manifests as a failure to thrive. In severe cases, failure to thrive may be followed by signs of renal and hepatic failure.</para>

Right-sided congestion may result in hepatosplenomegaly, jugular venous distention, edema, ascites, and/or pleural effusions. Uncompensated heart failure in older children may cause fatigue or lower-than-usual energy levels. Patients may complain of cool extremities, exercise intolerance, dizziness, or syncope.</para>

               <para>Many classes of disorders can result in increased cardiac demand or impaired cardiac function. Cardiac causes include arrhythmias (tachycardia or bradycardia), structural heart disease, and myocardial dysfunction (systolic or diastolic). Noncardiac causes include processes that increase the preload (volume overload), increase the afterload (hypertension), reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (anemia), or increase demand (sepsis). For example, renal failure can result in heart failure due to fluid retention and anemia. Lymphatic obstruction and venous obstruction syndromes can also cause edema-forming states, and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can lead to right-sided heart failure with right ventricular hypertrophy.</para>
               <para>Cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema</para>
               <para>Heart failure should also be differentiated from pulmonary edema associated with injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane caused by diverse etiologies (ie, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]). Increased capillary permeability is observed in trauma, hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, respiratory infections, administration of various drugs, and ingestion of toxins (eg, heroin, cocaine, toxic gases). With the advent of natriuretic peptide testing, differentiating cardiac from noncardiac causes of pulmonary edema has improved.<sup>

               </para>
               <para>Several features may differentiate cardiogenic from noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. In heart failure, a history of an acute cardiac event or of progressive symptoms of heart failure is usually present. The physical examination may yield clues to acute heart failure. Findings such as an S<sub>3</sub> gallop and elevated jugular venous pulsation are highly specific for acute heart failure, but their low sensitivity makes them less than ideal screening tools.<sup>

                  </sup>
               </para>
               <para>Patients with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may have clinical features similar to those with cardiogenic pulmonary edema but will often lack an S<sub>3</sub> gallop and jugular venous distention. Differentiation is often made based on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) measurements from invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Left ventricular filling pressures measured by PCWP are the single most reliable hemodynamic measure that predicts a fatal outcome in patients with acute heart failure. PCWP is generally more than 18 mm Hg in heart failure and is less than 18 mm Hg in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, but superimposition of chronic pulmonary vascular disease can make this distinction more difficult to discern.</para>
               <para>Atypical presentations</para>
               <para>Heart failure, in particular right-sided heart failure, can present as abdominal syndrome with nausea, vomiting, right-sided abdominal pain (as a sign of liver congestion), bloating, anorexia, and significant weight loss. In advanced cases, patients can appear jaundiced because of cardiac cirrhosis. Constipation is a common complaint among patients with heart failure, and it can be a manifestation of decreased intestinal transit secondary to poor perfusion. In very severe cases of cardiogenic shock, an individual can present with severe abdominal pain mimicking bowel obstruction, perforation, acute abdomen, and peritonitis as a manifestation of severe intestinal ischemia and possible infarction.</para>
               <para>In elderly patients, fatigue and confusion can sometimes be the first symptoms of heart failure, which is related to a decrease in cardiac output.</para>

            <pgroup>
               <para>Laboratory studies should include a complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes (including calcium and magnesium), and renal and liver function studies. Other tests may be indicated in specific patients. The CBC aids in the assessment of severe anemia, which may cause or aggravate heart failure. Leukocytosis may signal underlying infection. Otherwise, CBCs are usually of little diagnostic help.</para>
               <para>Serum electrolyte values are generally within reference ranges in patients with mild to moderate heart failure before treatment. In cases of severe heart failure, however, prolonged, rigid sodium restriction, coupled with intensive diuretic therapy and the inability to excrete water, may lead to dilutional hyponatremia, which occurs because of a substantial expansion of extracellular and intravascular fluid volume and a normal or increased level of total body sodium.</para>
               <para>Potassium levels are usually within reference ranges, although the prolonged administration of diuretics may result in hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia may occur in patients with severe heart failure who show marked reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and inadequate delivery of sodium to the distal tubular sodium-potassium exchange sites of the kidney, particularly if they are receiving potassium-sparing diuretics and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs).</para>

               <para>Patients with severe heart failure, particularly those on large doses of diuretics for long periods, may have elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicative of renal insufficiency because of chronic reductions of renal blood flow from reduced cardiac output. Diuresing this group of patients is complex. In some individuals, diuretics will improve renal congestion and renal function, whereas in others, overaggressive diuresis may aggravate renal insufficiency due to volume depletion.</para>

               <title>Liver function tests</title>
               <para>Congestive hepatomegaly and cardiac cirrhosis are often associated with impaired hepatic function, which is characterized by abnormal values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and other liver enzymes. Hyperbilirubinemia secondary to an increase in the directly and indirectly reacting bilirubin is common. In severe cases of acute RV or LV failure, frank jaundice may occur.</para>
               <para>Acute hepatic venous congestion can result in severe jaundice, with a bilirubin level as high as 15-20 mg/dL, elevation of AST to more than 10 times the upper reference range limit, elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase level, and prolongation of the prothrombin time. The clinical and laboratory pictures may resemble viral hepatitis, but the impairment of hepatic function is rapidly resolved by successful treatment of heart failure. In patients with long-standing heart failure, albumin synthesis may be impaired, leading to hypoalbuminemia and intensifying the accumulation of fluid. Fulminant hepatic failure is an uncommon, late, and sometimes terminal complication of cardiac cirrhosis.</para>

               <para>BNP is a 32-amino-acid polypeptide containing a 17-amino-acid ring structure common to all natriuretic peptides. The major source of plasma BNP is the cardiac ventricles, and the release of BNP appears to be in direct proportion to ventricular volume and pressure overload. BNP is an independent predictor of high LV end-diastolic pressure and is more useful than atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or norepinephrine levels for assessing mortality risk in patients with heart failure.<sup>

               <para>Although <link type="content" ref="1982163-overview">arterial blood gas (ABG)</link> measurement is more accurate than pulse oximetry for measuring oxygen saturation, it is unclear if ABG results add any clinical utility to pulse oximetry. In the setting of acute heart failure, ABG measurement is rarely performed. Indications include severe respiratory distress, documented hypoxemia by pulse oximetry not responsive to supplemental oxygen, and evidence of acidosis by serum chemistry or elevated lactate level.</para>
               <para>In general, heart failure patients who do not have comorbid lung disease do not manifest hypoxemia except in severe acute decompensation. Patients with severe heart failure may have signs and symptoms ranging from severe hypoxemia, or even hypoxia, along with hypercapnia, to decreased vital capacity and poor ventilation.</para>
               <para>ABG measurement helps assess the presence of hypercapnia, a potential early marker for impending respiratory failure. Hypoxemia and hypocapnia occur in stages 1 and 2 of pulmonary edema because of V/Q mismatch. In stage 3 of pulmonary edema, right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt develops secondary to alveolar flooding and further contributes to hypoxemia. In more severe cases, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis are usually observed. The decision regarding intubation and the use of mechanical ventilation is frequently based on many clinical parameters, including oxygenation, ventilation, and mental status. ABG values in isolation are rarely useful, but they may add to the entire clinical picture.</para>
               <para>Mixed venous oxygen saturation (obtained from the main pulmonary artery in the absence of an intracardiac shunt) is a good marker of the blood circulation time and therefore of cardiac output and cardiac performance. Patients who have advanced heart failure have low cardiac output and slower circulation time, which translate into an increased oxygen extraction by the tissue and therefore lower saturation of oxygen (&lt; 60% saturation).</para>

               <title>Pulse oximetry</title>
               <para>Pulse oximetry is highly accurate at assessing the presence of hypoxemia and, therefore, the severity of acute heart failure presentations. Patients with mild to moderate acute heart failure may show modest reductions in oxygen saturation, whereas patients with severe heart failure may have severe oxygen desaturation, even at rest. Pulse oximetry is also useful for monitoring the patient's response to supplemental oxygen and other therapies.</para>
               <para>Patients with mild to moderate heart failure may have normal oxygen saturations at rest, but they may exhibit marked reductions in oxygen saturations during physical exertion or recumbency. In general, arterial desaturation during exercise is not expected in heart failure and suggests the presence of comorbid lung disease. The use of continuous oxygen may be needed until compensation returns oxygen saturation to normal during exertion and recumbency or on a permanent basis if oxygen desaturation during exertion and/or recumbency exists during compensated severe chronic heart failure.</para>

                  <caption>This electrocardiogram (ECG) is from a 32-year-old female with recent-onset congestive heart failure and syncope. The ECG demonstrates a tachycardia with a 1:1 atrial:ventricular relationship. It is not clear from this tracing whether the atria are driving the ventricles (sinus tachycardia) or the ventricles are driving the atria (ventricular tachycardia).At first glance, sinus tachycardia in this ECG might be considered with severe conduction disease manifesting as marked first-degree atrioventricular block with left bundle branch block. Looking more closely, electrocardiographic morphology gives clues to the actual diagnosis of VT. These clues include the absence of RS complexes in the precordial leads, a QS pattern in V6, and an R wave in aVR. The patient proved to have an incessant VT associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. </caption>

               <para>Equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA) uses ECG events to define the temporal relationship between the acquisition of nuclear data and the volumetric components of the cardiac cycle. Sampling is performed repetitively over several hundred heartbeats, with physiologic segregation of nuclear data in accordance with their occurrence within the cardiac cycle.</para>
               <para>Data are quantified and displayed in an endless-loop, cinegraphic format for additional qualitative visual interpretation and analysis. Equilibrium blood-pool labeling is achieved by use of<sup>99m</sup> Tc. Data are analyzed by use of a computer, generally with some operator interaction.</para>
               <para>Analysis may be obtained in either the frame or list mode. Radionuclide data are collected and segregated temporally. The process generally requires 3-10 minutes for completion of each view. Following data acquisition, data from the several hundred individual beats are summed, processed, and displayed as a single representative cardiac cycle.</para>
               <para>Data from the left anterior oblique (LAO) view are also used for qualitative analysis of global LV function. On this view, overlap of the 2 ventricles is minimal. In a count-based approach, LVEF and other indices of filling and ejection are calculated from the LV radioactivity preset at various points throughout the cardiac cycle.</para>
               <para>RV function is best evaluated by first-pass techniques. The LAO view provides qualitative information concerning contraction of the septal, inferoapical, and lateral walls. The anterior view provides data concerning regional motion of the anterior and apical segments. The left lateral or left posterior oblique view provides optimal qualitative information concerning contraction of the inferior wall and posterobasal segment.</para>
               <para>ERNA may easily be combined with additional physiologic stress testing or provocation, which may be in the form of either physiologic stress, such as exercise; pharmacologic stress, with the use of positive inotropic agents, such as dobutamine or isoproterenol; or psychological stress.

               <para>PCWP can be measured by using a pulmonary arterial catheter (Swan-Ganz catheter). This helps differentiate cardiogenic causes of decompensated heart failure from noncardiogenic causes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs secondary to injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane rather than to alteration in Starling forces. A PCWP exceeding 18 mm Hg in a patient not known to have chronically elevated left atrial pressure is indicative of cardiogenic decompensated heart failure. In patients with chronic pulmonary capillary hypertension, capillary wedge pressures exceeding 25 mm Hg are generally required to overcome the pumping capacity of the lymphatics and produce pulmonary edema.</para>
               <para>Large V waves may be observed in the PCWP tracing in patients with significant mitral regurgitation because large volumes of blood regurgitate into a poorly compliant left atrium. This raises pulmonary venous pressure and may cause pulmonary edema.</para>

               <para>A sudden increase in creatinine can be seen after initiation of diuretic therapy and is often mistakenly considered evidence of overdiuresis or intravascular depletion (even in the presence of fluid overload). A common error in this situation is to decrease the dose of ACEI/ARB and/or diuretics or to even withdraw one of these agents. In fact, when diuresis or ultrafiltration is continued, patients demonstrate improved renal function, decreased total body fluid, and increased response to diuretics, as central venous pressure falls.</para>
               <para>Low-dose dopamine has been used in combination with diuretic therapy, on the supposition that it can increase kidney perfusion. Data have been contradictory, however.

In addition, patients who received dopamine and furosemide were less likely to have worsened renal function or hypokalemia at 24 hours.<sup>

               <para>Nitrates are potent venodilators. They decrease preload and therefore decrease LV filling pressure and relieve shortness of breath. They also selectively produce epicardial coronary artery vasodilatation and help with myocardial ischemia.

This agent is particularly helpful for patients who present with severe pulmonary congestion in the presence of hypertension and severe mitral regurgitation. Sodium nitroprusside requires not only careful hemodynamic monitoring, often requiring indwelling catheters, but also monitoring for cyanide toxicity, especially in the presence of renal dysfunction. The drug should be titrated to off rather than abruptly stopped because of the potential for rebound hypertension.</para>

This feature allows for the advantages of a closed system, which potentially reduces sources of infection, a known complication of earlier devices.</para>

Although all subsequently died, 4 patients were ambulatory after surgery, and 2 were discharged from the hospital to a transitional-care setting. One of the discharged patients was discharged on postoperative day 209. A limitation of the AbioCor TAH is its large size, which permits its implantation in only 50% of men and 20% of women. In 2006, the FDA approved the Abiocor TAH as a permanent TAH for humanitarian uses.</para>

The ECG demonstrates a tachycardia with a 1:1 atrial:ventricular relationship. It is not clear from this tracing whether the atria are driving the ventricles (sinus tachycardia) or the ventricles are driving the atria (ventricular tachycardia).At first glance, sinus tachycardia in this ECG might be considered with severe conduction disease manifesting as marked first-degree atrioventricular block with left bundle branch block. Looking more closely, electrocardiographic morphology gives clues to the actual diagnosis of VT. These clues include the absence of RS complexes in the precordial leads, a QS pattern in V6, and an R wave in aVR.

The rSR' type complex in the lateral leads (I, aVL) is not due to a right bundle branch block (RBBB) but to an atypical left ventricular conduction defect. These unexpected rSR' complexes in the lateral leads (El-Sherif sign) correlate with underlying extensive myocardial infarction (MI) and, occasionally, ventricular aneurysm. (El-Sherif. Br Heart J. 1970;32:440-8.) The notching on the upstroke of the S waves in lead V4 with a left bundle branch block-type pattern also suggests underlying MI (Cabrera sign). This patient had severe cardiomyopathy secondary to coronary artery disease, with extensive left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Image courtesy of http://ecg.bidmc.harvard.edu . </caption>

               <caption>On this electrocardiogram, baseline artifact is present, simulating atrial fibrillation. Such artifact may be caused by a variety of factors, including poor electrode contact, muscle tremor, and electrical interference. A single premature ventricular complex (PVC) is present with a compensatory pause such that the RR interval surrounding the PVC is twice as long as the preceding sinus RR interval. Evidence of a previous anterior myocardial infarction is present with pathologic Q waves in leads V1-V3. Borderline-low precordial voltage is a nonspecific finding. Cardiac catheterization showed a 90% stenosis in the patient's proximal portion the left anterior descending coronary artery, which was treated with angioplasty and stenting. Broad P waves in lead V1 with a prominent negative component is consistent with a left atrial abnormality. Image courtesy of http://ecg.bidmc.harvard.edu . </caption>

               <caption>This electrocardiogram (ECG) is from a patient who underwent urgent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse severe coronary spasm (most marked in the left circumflex system) without any fixed obstructive lesions. Severe left ventricular wall motion abnormalities were present, involving the anterior and inferior segments. A question of so-called takotsubo cardiomyopathy (left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome) is also raised (see Bybee et al. Systematic review: transient left ventricular apical ballooning: a syndrome that mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Ann Int Med 2004:141:858-65). The latter is most often reported in postmenopausal, middle-aged to elderly women in the context of acute emotional stress and may cause ST elevations acutely with subsequent T wave inversions. A cocaine-induced cardiomyopathy (possibly related to coronary vasospasm) is a consideration but was excluded here. Myocarditis may also be associated with this type of ECG and the cardiomyopathic findings shown here. No fixed obstructive epicardial coronary lesions were detected by coronary arteriography. The findings in this ECG include low-amplitude QRS complexes in the limb leads (with an indeterminate QRS axis), loss of normal precordial R wave progression (leads V1-V3), and prominent anterior/lateral T wave inversions.
